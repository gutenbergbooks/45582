<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>JACK WINS A RACE</small></h2>


<p>“Now, then, are you all ready?”</p>

<p>“I’m as ready as I ever shall be,” answered Jack
Ranger, in reply to the question from Sam
Chalmers. “Let her go!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” cried Dock Snaith. “I want
to put a little more oil on my oarlocks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re always fussing about something,
Dock,” said Sam. “It looks as if you didn’t want
to go into this race after all your boasting.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it does,” came from Nat Anderson.</p>

<p>“Hu! Think I can’t beat Jack Ranger?” replied
Dock with a sneer as he began putting more
oil on the oarlock sockets. “I could beat him
rowing with one hand.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” cried Sam. “You’ve got a swelled
head, Dock.”</p>

<p>“I have, eh?”</p>

<p>“Now are you ready?” asked Sam again, as he
stepped forward and raised the pistol, ready to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_2" href="#Page_2"><span title="2">&#160;</span></a>
fire the starting shot in a small race between Jack
Ranger, one of the best-liked students at Washington
Hall, and Dock Snaith, a bullying sort of
chap, but who, in spite of his rather mean ways,
had some friends.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m all ready now,” replied Dock, as
he got on the center of the seat and adjusted the
oars.</p>

<p>“Better send for your secretary to make sure,”
said Nat Anderson, and at this there was a laugh
from the students who had gathered to see the
contest. “Rusticating rowlocks, but you’re slow!”</p>

<p>“You mind your own business, Anderson,” came
from the bully, “or I’ll make you.”</p>

<p>“It’ll take more than you to make me,” responded
Nat boldly, for more than once he had
come into conflict with Snaith and did not fear
him.</p>

<p>“It will, eh? Well, if I can get out of this
boat——”</p>

<p>“Aw, go on! Row if you’re going to!” exclaimed
Sam. “Think I haven’t anything to do
except stay here and start this race? You challenged
Jack, now go ahead and beat him—if you
can.”</p>

<p>“Yes, come on,” added Jack, a tall, good-looking,
bronzed youth, who sat on the seat in the
small boat, impatiently moving the oars slowly to
and fro.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_3" href="#Page_3"><span title="3">&#160;</span></a>“Oh, I’ll beat you,” said the bully confidently.
“You can give the word whenever you’re ready,
Chalmers.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s awfully kind of you, really it is,”
said Jack in a high, falsetto voice, which produced
another laugh.</p>

<p>Dock Snaith scowled at Jack, but said nothing.
There was a moment’s delay, while Sam looked
down the course to see if all was clear on Rudmore
Lake, where the contest was taking place.</p>

<p>“I’m going to fire!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>The two contestants gripped their oars a little
more firmly, they leaned forward, ready to plunge
them into the water and pull a heavy stroke at the
sound of the pistol. Their eyes were bright with
anticipation, and their muscles tense.</p>

<p>Crack! There was a puff of white smoke, a
little sliver of flame, hardly noticeable in the bright
October sunlight; then <del class="correction">same</del><ins
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has “same”"
    class="correction">came</ins> a splash in the water as the broad blades
were dipped in, and the race was on.</p>

<p>“Jack’s got the lead! Jack’s ahead!” cried the
friends of our hero, as they ran along the shore
of the lake.</p>

<p>“Dock is only tiring him out,” added the adherents
of the school bully. “He’ll come in strong
at the finish.”</p>

<p>“He will if he doesn’t tire out,” was Nat Anderson’s<a class="pagenum" id="Page_4" href="#Page_4"><span title="4">&#160;</span></a>
opinion. “Dock smokes too many cigarettes
to be a good oarsman.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think Ranger will have it all
his own way?” spoke Pud Armstrong, a crony of
Snaith.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” was Nat’s answer as he
jogged along. “But I think he’s the better rower.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” sneered Pud.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll see,” admitted Nat.</p>

<p>The two contestants were now rowing steadily.
They had a little over a mile to go to reach the
Point, as <del class="correction">ist</del><ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has “ist”">it</ins> was called; that
being the usual limit of impromptu racing events.</p>

<p>The contest between Jack Ranger and Dock
Snaith was the result of an argument on oarsmanship,
which had taken place in the school gym the
night before. It was shortly after the opening of
the term at Washington Hall, and in addition to
football, which would soon be in full sway, there
was rowing to occupy the attention of the students,
for the lake, on the shores of which the academy
was situated, was well adapted for aquatic sports.</p>

<p>The talk had turned on who were the best individual
oarsmen in the school, and Jack Ranger’s
friends lost no time in mentioning him as the champion,
for more than once he had demonstrated that
in a single shell, or a large, eight-oared one, he
could pull a winning stroke.</p>

<p>Dock Snaith’s admirers were not slow in advocating<a class="pagenum" id="Page_5" href="#Page_5"><span title="5">&#160;</span></a>
his powers, and the bully, not at all backward
to boast of his own abilities, had challenged
Jack to a small race the next day. Jack had consented,
and the contest was now under way.</p>

<p>“Jack’s going to walk right away from him,”
said Dick Balmore, otherwise known as “Bony,”
from the manner in which his inner skeleton was
visible through his skin, and from a habit he had
of cracking his knuckles.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” cautioned Sam. “Snaith
has lots of muscle. Our only hope is that he won’t
last. His wind isn’t very good, and Jack has set
him a fast clip.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Dock,” cried Pud Armstrong. “Go
on! You can do him easy!”</p>

<p>Dock nodded, the boats both being so close to
shore that ordinary conversation could easily be
heard.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Jack!” cried Nat Anderson.
“Keep it up!”</p>

<p>Jack had increased his stroke two or three more
per minute, and Dock found it necessary to do
likewise, in order not to get too far behind. He
was letting his rival set the pace, and so far had
been content merely to trail along, with the sharp
bow of his frail craft lapping the stern of Jack’s
a few feet.</p>

<p>“Dock’s holding back for the finish,” remarked<a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" href="#Page_6"><span title="6">&#160;</span></a>
Pud as he raced along, and in passing Nat he dug
his elbow into the side of Jack’s chum.</p>

<p>“Well, if he is, that’s no reason why you should
try to puncture my inner tubes,” expostulated Nat.
“I’ll pitch you into the lake if you do that again.”</p>

<p>“Aw, you’re getting mad ’cause Jack’s going to
lose,” sneered Pud.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is,” added Glen Forker, another
crony of the bully.</p>

<p>“Am I? Just wait,” was all Nat answered as
he rubbed his ribs. “Slithering side saddles! but
you gave me a dig!”</p>

<p>The contestants were now rowing more rapidly,
and the students on shore, who were following the
race, had to increase their pace to keep up to them.</p>

<p>“Hit it up a little, Jack!” called Sam. “You’ve
got him breathing hard.”</p>

<p>“He has—not! I’m—I’m all right,” answered
Dock from his boat, and very foolishly, too, for
he was getting winded, and he needed to save all
his breath, and not waste it in talking. Besides,
the halting manner in which he answered showed
his condition. Sam noticed it at once.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him! You’ve got him, Jack!” he
cried exultantly. “Go on! Row hard!”</p>

<p>“Say, that ain’t fair!” cried Pud Armstrong.</p>

<p>“What isn’t?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Telling Jack like that. Let him find out about
Dock.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_7" href="#Page_7"><span title="7">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I guess I know what’s fair,” replied Sam with
a withering look. “I’ll call all I want to, and don’t
you interfere with me, or it won’t be healthy for
you.”</p>

<p>Pud subsided. Sam Chalmers was the foremost
authority, among the students, on everything connected
with games and sports, for he played on
the football eleven, on the nine, and was a general
leader.</p>

<p>“You’d better hit it up a bit, Dock,” was Glen
Forker’s advice to his crony, as he saw Jack’s lead
increasing. “Beat him good and proper.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have to get up earlier in the morning
if he wants to do that,” commented Bony Balmore,
as he cracked his big knuckles in his excitement.</p>

<p>And it was high time for Dock to do some rowing.
Jack had not been unaware of his rival’s
difficulty, and deciding that the best way to win
the race would be to make a spurt and tire him
out before the finish, he “hit up a faster clip,” the
broad blades of the oars dipping into the water,
coming out and going in again with scarcely a
ripple.</p>

<p>“There he goes! There he goes!” cried Sam.
“That’s the ticket, Jack!”</p>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” yelled Nat.</p>

<p>“Get right after him, Dock,” advised Pud.</p>

<p>“You can beat him! Do it!” cried Glen.</p>

<p>But it was easier said than done. Jack was rowing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8"><span title="8">&#160;</span></a>
his best, and when our hero did that it was
“going some,” as Sam used to say. He had opened
up quite a stretch of water between his boat and
Dock’s, and the bully, with a quick glance over his
shoulder, seeing this, resolved to close it up and
then pass his rival. There was less than a quarter
of a mile to the finish, and he must needs row hard
if he was to win.</p>

<p>Dock bent to the task. He was a powerfully
built lad, and had he been in good condition there
is no question but what he could have beaten Jack.
But cigarette-smoking, an occasional bottle of beer,
late hours and too much rich food had made him
fat, and anything but an ideal athlete.</p>

<p>Still he had plenty of “row” left in him yet, as
he demonstrated a few seconds later, when by
increasing not only the number of his strokes per
minute, but also putting more power into them,
he crept up on Jack, until he was even with him.</p>

<p>Jack rowed the same rate he had settled on to
pull until he was within a short distance of the
finish. He was saving himself for a spurt.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dock’s boat crept a little past Jack’s.</p>

<p>“There he goes! There he goes!” cried Pud,
capering about on the bank in delight. “What did
I tell you?”</p>

<p>“He’ll win easy,” was Glen’s opinion.</p>

<p>“It isn’t over yet,” remarked Nat quietly, but<a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" href="#Page_9"><span title="9">&#160;</span></a>
he glanced anxiously at Sam, who shook his head
in a reassuring manner.</p>

<p>Dock began to increase his lead. Jack looked
over his shoulder for one glance at his rival’s boat.
The two were now rowing well and swiftly.</p>

<p>“Go on, Jack! Go on! Go on!” begged Bony,
cracking his eight fingers and two thumbs in rapid
succession, like a battery of popguns. “Don’t let
him beat you!”</p>

<p>Dock was now a boat’s length ahead, and rowing
well, but a critical observer could notice that
his breathing distressed him.</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance, Jack!” yelled Sam.</p>

<p>But Jack did not need any one to tell him. Another
glance over his shoulder at his rival showed
him that the time had come to make the spurt. He
leaned forward, took a firmer grip on the ash
handles, and then gave such an exhibition of rowing
as was seldom seen at Washington Hall.</p>

<p>Dock saw his enemy coming, and tried to stave
off defeat, but it was no use. He was completely
fagged out. Jack went right past him, “as if
Dock was standing still,” was the way Sam expressed
it.</p>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” screamed Pud. “You’ve got
to row, Dock!”</p>

<p>But Dock could not imitate the pace that Jack
had set. He tried, but the effort was saddening.
He splashed, and the oars all but slipped from<a class="pagenum" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10"><span title="10">&#160;</span></a>
his hands. His heart was fluttering like that of a
wounded bird.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him! You’ve got him, Jack!”
yelled Nat; and, sure enough, Jack Ranger had.</p>

<p>On and on he rowed, increasing every second
the open water between his boat and his rival’s,
until he shot past the Point, a winner by several
lengths.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it!”</p>

<p>“I knew he’d win!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Jack Ranger!”</p>

<p>These, and other cries of victory, greeted our
hero’s ears as he allowed his oars to rest on the
water flat, while he recovered his wind after the
heart-breaking finish.</p>

<p>“Well, Dock could beat him if he was in training,”
said Pud doggedly.</p>

<p>“That’s what he could,” echoed Glen.</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years!” was Nat’s positive
assertion.</p>

<p>The boys crowded to the float that marked the
finish of the course. Jack reached it first, and
stepped out of his shell, being greeted by his
friends. Then Dock rowed slowly up. His distress
showed plainly in his puffy, white face.</p>

<p>He got out clumsily, and staggered as he clambered
upon the float.</p>

<p>“Hard luck, old man,” said Jack good-humoredly.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11"><span title="11">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I don’t want your sympathy!” snapped Dock.
“I’ll row you again, and I’ll beat you!”</p>

<p>Jack had held out his hand, but the bully ignored
it. He turned aside, and whether the float
tilted, or whether Snaith tottered because of a
cramp in his leg, was never known, but he staggered
for a moment, tried unsuccessfully to recover
his balance, and then plunged into the lake at one
of the deepest spots, right off the float.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_12" href="#Page_12"><span title="12">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE NEW BOY</small></h2>


<p>“There goes Dock!”</p>

<p>“Pull him out!”</p>

<p>“Yes, before he gets under the float!”</p>

<p>“He can’t swim! He’s too exhausted!”</p>

<p>These were some of the expressions the excited
lads shouted as they surged forward to look at the
spot where Dock had disappeared. A string of
bubbles and some swirling eddies were all that
marked the place.</p>

<p>The float began to tilt with the weight of so
many boys on one edge.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” cried Jack Ranger. “Stand back,
or we’ll all be in the lake!”</p>

<p>They heeded his words, and moved toward the
middle of the platform.</p>

<p>“Some one ought to go in after him,” said Pud
Armstrong, his teeth fairly chattering from fright
and nervousness. “I—I can’t swim.”</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Jack. “I’m going in!”</p>

<p>He began pulling off the sweater which some of
the lads had helped put on him, when he stepped
from the shell all perspiration.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13"><span title="13">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>He poised for an instant on the edge of the
float, looking down into the dark waters, beneath
which Dock had disappeared, and then dived in.</p>

<p>“Get one of the boats out. Maybe he won’t come
up near the float,” <del class="correction">order</del><ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has “order”">ordered</ins> Sam
Chalmers, and several lads hurriedly shoved out into the lake a broad barge,
which could safely be used by Jack in getting Dock out of the water, if he was
fortunate enough to find the youth.</p>

<p>“Queer he doesn’t come up,” spoke Glen in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Who—Dock or Jack?” asked Bony, cracking
his finger knuckles in double relays.</p>

<p>“Dock.”</p>

<p>“He’s too exhausted,” replied Bony. “Can’t
swim. But Jack’ll get him.”</p>

<p>How long it seemed since Jack had dived down!
The swirl he made had subsided, and the water
was almost calm again. Anxiously the lads on the
float and shore watched to see him reappear.
Would he come up alone, or would he bring Dock
with him?</p>

<p>“Maybe Jack hit his head on something,” suggested
Nat.</p>

<p>“Jack knows how to dive, and it’s deep here,”
said Sam. “I guess he’ll come up all right,
but——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. At that moment<a class="pagenum" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14"><span title="14">&#160;</span></a>
there was a disturbance beneath the surface
of the lake. A head bobbed up.</p>

<p>“There’s Jack!” cried Bony delightedly.</p>

<p>A white arm shot up and began sweeping the
water.</p>

<p>“He’s got him!” yelled Nat. “He’s got Dock!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, Jack had come to the surface, encircling
in his left arm the unconscious form of
Dock Snaith, while with his sturdy right he was
swimming slowly toward the float.</p>

<p>“The boat! the boat! It’s nearer!” cried Sam,
for Jack had come up at some distance from the
little pier and closer to the rowboat which had put
out from shore.</p>

<p>Jack heard and understood. Turning, he began
swimming toward the craft, and the lads in it
rowed toward him. A few seconds later Jack had
clutched the gunwale, holding Dock’s head out of
water.</p>

<p>Several eager hands reached down to grasp our
hero.</p>

<p>“Take—take him first,” he said pantingly. “I’m—I’m
all right.”</p>

<p>Dock was hauled into the boat.</p>

<p>“Now row ashore. I’ll swim it,” went on Jack.
“Get the water out of him as soon as you can. He—he
was right on the bottom. Struck—struck on
the—on the float, I guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take you in,” cried Bob Movel.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15"><span title="15">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Sure! There’s lots of room,” added Fred
Kaler.</p>

<p>“No. Get Dock on shore,” ordered Jack, and
they obeyed.</p>

<p>Relieved of his burden, and having recovered
his wind, Jack swam slowly to the float. The boat
reached it some time ahead of him, and Dock was
lifted out, while, under the direction of Sam
Chalmers, the students administered first aid to
the drowned.</p>

<p>Dock was turned over on his face, a roll of coats
having been placed under his stomach to aid in
forcing the water out of him. There was no need
to remove his clothing, as he and Jack were clad
only in rowing trunks and light shirts.</p>

<p>“Now turn him over on his back and hold out
his tongue, fellows,” directed Sam, and this was
done, the tongue being held by Nat Anderson,
who used his handkerchief to prevent it slipping
away. This was done so that it might not fall back
into the throat and prevent Dock from breathing.</p>

<p>“Now work his arms! Over his head! Press
up his diaphragm and start artificial respiration,”
went on Sam, and under the ministrations of the
lads, Dock soon began to breathe again.</p>

<p>He sighed, took in a long breath naturally,
opened his eyes, and gasped feebly.</p>

<p>“He’s all right now,” said Sam in a relieved tone.
“How do you feel, Dock?”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16"><span title="16">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“All—right—I—guess. My head——”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes again. Sam passed his hand
over the prostrate lad’s skull.</p>

<p>“He’s got a nasty cut there,” he said, as he
felt of a big lump, “but I guess it’s not serious.
We must get him up to the school.”</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s carry him,” suggested Nat.</p>

<p>“Never mind—here comes Hexter!” cried Bony.</p>

<p>As he spoke the chug-chugging of an automobile
was heard, and a touring car came along the road
down to the float. It was a machine kept at
Washington Hall, and used by the teachers, and,
occasionally, when Hexter, the chauffeur, would
allow it, by the students.</p>

<p>“Dr.&#160;Mead sent me down to see what the matter
was,” said Hexter as he stopped the car. “He
saw a crowd on the float and thought something
might have happened.”</p>

<p>“There has,” replied Sam. “Here, Hexter, help
us get Dock into the car, and then throw on all
the speed you’ve got, if you have to blow out a
spark-plug.”</p>

<p>“Is he—is he dead?” asked Hexter quickly.</p>

<p>“No; only stunned. Lively, now!”</p>

<p>Hexter aided the boys in lifting Dock into the
machine, and then he made speed to the school,
where the injured lad was cared for by Dr.&#160;Henry
Mead, the master of Washington Hall.</p>

<p>“Well, that was an exciting finish to the race,”<a class="pagenum" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17"><span title="17">&#160;</span></a>
remarked Jack as he walked up from the float to
the shore, surrounded by some of his chums, after
Dock had been taken away.</p>

<p>“He oughtn’t to try to row,” said Fred Kaler.
“He hasn’t got the staying powers.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t have to-day,” observed Jack;
“but if he would only train, he’d make a good
oarsman. He’s got lots of muscle. I hope he
isn’t hurt much.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right in a few days,” was Nat’s
opinion. “Say, Jack, but you’re shivering.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that water’s a little cooler than it was
Fourth of July.”</p>

<p>“Here, put a couple of sweaters on,” went on
Nat, and soon Jack was warmly wrapped up.</p>

<p>“Now run up and change your duds,” advised
Bony, and Jack broke into a dog-trot, his friends
trailing along behind him and discussing the race
and the accident.</p>

<p>While they are thus engaged I will take the
opportunity to tell you a little something about
Jack Ranger and his friends, so that you who have
not previously read of him may feel better acquainted
with our hero.</p>

<p>The first volume of this series was called “Jack
Ranger’s Schooldays,” and in it there was related
some of the fun Jack and his special friend, Nat
Anderson, had in their native town of Denton. So
exciting were some of their escapades that it was<a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18"><span title="18">&#160;</span></a>
decided to send them off to boarding-school, and
Washington Hall, sometimes called Lakeside
Academy, from the fact that it was located on
the shore of Lake Rudmore, was selected. There
Jack made friends with most of the students, including
some who have already been mentioned
in this present tale. He incurred the enmity of a
bully, Jerry Chowden, who, however, was not now
at the academy, as you will presently learn.</p>

<p>Jack’s home was with three maiden aunts, the
Misses Angelina, Josephine and Mary Stebbins,
who took good care of him. In the first volume
there was related something of a certain mystery
concerning Jack’s father, Robert Ranger, and how
he had to go into hiding in the West because of
complications over a land deal.</p>

<p>In the second volume of the series, “Jack
Ranger’s Western Trip,” was related what happened
to Jack, Nat Anderson, and a half-breed
Indian, John Smith, whose acquaintance Jack had
made at Washington Hall, when they went West
in search of Mr.&#160;Ranger.</p>

<p>They journeyed to a ranch, owned by Nat’s
uncle, and they had many exciting times, not a few
of which were caused by a certain faker, whose real
name was Hemp Smith, but who assumed the title
Marinello Booghoobally, and various other appellations
as suited his fancy.</p>

<p>Mr.&#160;Ranger was located, but only after the boys<a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19"><span title="19">&#160;</span></a>
had suffered many hardships and gone through not
a few perils, and Jack was happy to be able to bring
his father back East, there being no longer any
reason for Mr.&#160;Ranger remaining in exile.</p>

<p>“Jack Ranger’s School Victories,” was the title
of the third volume, and in that was told of Jack’s
successes on track, gridiron and diamond. Hemp
Smith and Jerry Chowden made trouble for him,
but he bested them. He had plenty of fun, for
which two teachers at the school, Professor Socrat,
an instructor in French, and Professor Garlach, a
German authority, furnished an excuse.</p>

<p>But Jack’s activities did not all center about the
school. There was told in the fourth volume,
“Jack Ranger’s Ocean Cruise,” what happened to
him and his chums when they went camping one
summer. Jack, Nat Anderson, Sam Chalmers,
Bony Balmore, and an odd character, Budge Rankin,
who chewed gum and ran his words together,
went off to live in the woods, near the seacoast, for
a few weeks.</p>

<p>There they fell in with a scoundrel named Jonas
Lavine, who was aided in his plots by Jerry
Chowden and Hemp Smith.</p>

<p>Jack and his chums stumbled upon a printing
plant, maintained in a cave by Lavine and his confederates,
where bogus bonds were made. Before
they had time to inform the authorities Jack and
Nat were captured by Lavine and sent to sea in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20"><span title="20">&#160;</span></a>
a ship in charge of Captain Reeger, a tool of
Lavine.</p>

<p>Jack learned that Captain Reeger wanted to be
freed from the toils of Lavine, and our hero agreed
to assist him, in return for which the captain said
he would aid Jack.</p>

<p>Jack and Nat managed to get out of the cabin
in which they were confined. As they were about
to escape from the <i>Polly Ann</i> a terrible storm came
up, and the ship was wrecked. But not before
Jerry Chowden had boarded her, to help in keeping
Jack and Nat captives.</p>

<p>They had many hardships, afloat on a raft in
a fog, and saved Jerry Chowden from drowning.
Finally they were rescued, and Lavine and his
confederates were arrested, Captain Reeger being
exonerated. Jerry Chowden fled to the West, fearing
arrest should he remain in the East. Jack and
his chums were reunited, and they again enjoyed
life under the canvas, until it was time to resume
their studies at Washington Hall, where the opening
of this story finds them.</p>

<p>As Jack and his chums walked up the gravel path
to the dormitories, where our hero intended to get
into dry clothes, the group of youths chatting eagerly
of the events which had just taken place passed
a lad standing beneath a clump of trees. The latter,
instead of coming to join the throng, turned away.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21"><span title="21">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Who’s that?” asked Jack of Bony Balmore.
“I don’t remember to have seen him before.”</p>

<p>“He’s a new boy,” replied Bony, cracking three
finger knuckles in his absent-minded way.</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Will Williams.”</p>

<p>“Looks like a nice sort of chap,” added Nat.</p>

<p>“But his face is sad,” said Jack slowly. “I
wonder why he should be sad when he’s at such a
jolly place as Washington Hall?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s lonesome,” suggested Fred Kaler.</p>

<p>“Give him a tune on your mouth-organ, and
he’ll be more so,” spoke Bob Movel, but he took
good care to get beyond the reach of Fred’s fist,
at this insult to his musical abilities.</p>

<p>“Let’s make friends with him,” went on Jack.
“Hey, Williams, come on over and get acquainted,”
he called.</p>

<p>But the new boy, instead of answering, or turning
to join the happy crowd of students, kept on
walking away.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Jack, with a puzzled look
at his chums. “Fellows, there’s something wrong
about that boy. I can tell by his face, and I’m
going to find out what it is.”</p>

<p>“You’d better get dry first,” suggested Nat.</p>

<p>“I will, but later I’m going to make that lad’s
acquaintance. He looks as if he needed a friend.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22"><span title="22">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>A CURIOUS LAD</small></h2>


<p>“There’s Hexter!” exclaimed Jack as he saw
the chauffeur slowly running the automobile to the
garage. “Hello, Hexter, is Snaith all right?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” replied the automobilist. “Dr.&#160;Mead
says the hurt on his head doesn’t amount to
much, and that he is suffering mostly from shock.
He’ll be all right in a day or so.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Jack. “I don’t want him
to be laid up right after I won the race from him.”</p>

<p>The students began to disperse, Jack to remove
his wet clothes, and the others to retire to their
rooms to get ready for the summons to supper,
which would soon sound.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr.&#160;Ranger!” exclaimed Socker, the
janitor at Washington Hall, as he saw Jack entering
the gymnasium, “you’re all wet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a trifle difficult to fall in the lake and
keep dry, especially at this time of year,” went
on Jack. “But I say, Socker, get me a couple of
good, dry, heavy towels, will you? I want to take
a rub-down.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23"><span title="23">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I certainly will, Mr.&#160;Ranger. So you fell in
the lake, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I jumped in.”</p>

<p>“Jumped in? Why, that reminds me of what
happened when I was fighting in the Battle of the
Wilderness, in the Civil War. We were on the
march, and we came to a little stream. The captain
called for us to jump over, but——”</p>

<p>“Say, Socker, if it’s all the same to you will you
chop that off there, and make it continued in our
next? I’m cold, and I want to rub-down. Get
me the towels, and then I’ll listen to that yarn.
If there’s one kind of a story I like above all others,
it’s about war. I want to hear what happened,
but not now.”</p>

<p>“Do you really? Then I’ll tell you after you’ve
rubbed down,” and Socker hurried off after the
towels. He was always telling of what he called
his war experiences, though there was very much
doubt that he had ever been farther than a temporary
camp. He repeated the same stories so
often that the boys had become tired of them, and
lost no chance to escape from his narratives.</p>

<p>“There you are, Mr.&#160;Ranger,” went on the
janitor as he came back with the towels. “Now,
as soon as you’re dry I’ll tell you that story about
the Battle of the Wilderness.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not if I know it,” said Jack to himself,
as he went in the room where the shower-baths<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24"><span title="24">&#160;</span></a>
were, to take a warm one. “I’ll sneak out the
back way.”</p>

<p>Which he did, after his rub-down, leaving
Socker sitting in the main room of the gym, waiting
for him, and wondering why the lad did not come
out to hear the war story.</p>

<p>Jack reached his room, little the worse for his
experience at the lake. He possessed a fine appetite,
which he was soon appeasing by vigorous attacks
on the food in the dining-room.</p>

<p>“I say, Jack,” called Nat, “have you heard the
latest?”</p>

<p>“What’s that? Has the clock struck?” inquired
Jack, ready to have some joke sprung on him.</p>

<p>“No, but Fred Kaler has composed a song about
the race and your rescue. He’s going to play it on
the mouth-organ, and sing it at the same time to-night.”</p>

<p>“I am not, you big duffer!” cried Fred, throwing
a generous crust of bread at Nat, but first
taking good care to see that Martin, the monitor,
was not looking.</p>

<p>“Sure he is,” insisted Nat.</p>

<p>“Tell him how it goes,” suggested Bony.</p>

<p>“It’s to the tune of ‘Who Put Tacks in Willie’s
Shoes?’” went on Nat, <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: quote added">“</ins>and the first verse is
something like this——”</p>

<p>“Aw, cheese it, will you?” pleaded Fred, blushing,
but Nat went on:</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25"><span title="25">&#160;</span></a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You have heard about the glorious deeds<br /></span>

<span class="i2">He jumped in waters cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rescued one whom he had beat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a race that he had led,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Nat, amid laughter.</p>

<p>“Punk!” cried one student.</p>

<p>“Put it on ice!” added another.</p>

<p>“Can it!”</p>

<p>“Cage it!”</p>

<p>“Put salt on its tail! It’s wild!”</p>

<p>“Put a new record in; that one scratches.”</p>

<p>These were some of the calls that greeted Nat’s
rendition of what he said was Fred’s song.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26"><span title="26">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I never made that up!” cried the musical student.
“I can make better verse than that.”</p>

<p>“Go on, give us the tune,” shouted Sam.</p>

<p>“That’s right—make him play,” came a score
of calls.</p>

<p>“Order, young gentlemen, order!” suddenly interrupted
the harsh voice of Martin, the monitor.
“I shall be obliged to report you to Dr.&#160;Mead
unless you are more quiet.”</p>

<p>“Send in Professors Socrat and Garlach,” <del
    class="correction">advisd</del><ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has “advisd”">advised</ins> Jack. “They
can keep order.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, and we’ll get them to sing Fred’s
song,” added Sam Chalmers.</p>

<p>“Ranger—Chalmers—silence!” ordered Martin,
and not wishing to be sent to Dr.&#160;Mead’s office
the two lively students, as well as their no
less fun-loving companions, subsided.</p>

<p>Quiet finally reigned in the regions of Washington
Hall, for the students had to retire to their
rooms to study. There were mysterious whisperings
here and there, however, and occasionally
shadowy forms moved about the corridors, for, in
spite of rules against it, the lads would visit each
other in their rooms after hours. Several called
on Jack to see how he felt after his experience.
They found him and Nat Anderson busy looking
over some gun catalogues.</p>

<p>“Going in for hunting?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” replied Jack. “Say, there are some<a class="pagenum" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27"><span title="27">&#160;</span></a>
dandy rifles in this book, and they’re cheap, too.
I’d like to get one.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” added Sam.</p>

<p>“And go hunting,” put in Bony, cracking his
finger knuckles, as if firing off an air-rifle.</p>

<p>“It would be sport to organize a gun club, and
do some hunting,” went on Jack. “Only I’d like
to shoot bigger game than there is around here.
Maybe we can——”</p>

<p>“Hark, some one’s coming! It’s Martin,” said
Fred Kaler in a whisper.</p>

<p>Jack’s hand shot out and quickly turned down
the light. Then he bounded into bed, dressed as
he was. Nat followed his example. It was well
that they did so, for a moment later there came a
knock on their door, and the voice of Martin, the
monitor, asked:</p>

<p>“Ranger, are you in bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied our hero.</p>

<p>“Anderson, are you in bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Martin.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I thought I heard voices in your
room.”</p>

<p>Jack replied with a snore, and the monitor
passed on.</p>

<p>“You fellows had better take a sneak,” whispered
Jack, when Martin’s footsteps had died
away. “He’s watching this room, and he may
catch you.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28"><span title="28">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>The outsiders thought this was good advice, and
soon Nat and Jack were left alone.</p>

<p>“Did you mean that about a gun club?” asked
Nat.</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied his chum, “but we’ll talk about
it to-morrow. Better go to sleep. Martin will be
sneaking around.”</p>

<p>Jack was up early the next morning, and went
down to the lake for a row before breakfast. As
he approached the float, where he kept his boat,
he saw a student standing there.</p>

<p>“That looks like the new chap—Will Williams,”
he mused. “I’ll ask him to go for a row.”</p>

<p>He approached the new lad, and was again
struck by a peculiar look of sadness on his face.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said Jack pleasantly. “My
name is Ranger. Wouldn’t you like to go for a
row?”</p>

<p>Will Williams turned and looked at Jack for
several seconds without speaking. He did not
seem to have heard what was said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s a trifle deaf,” thought Jack, and
he asked again more loudly:</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to go for a row?”</p>

<p>“I don’t row,” was the answer, rather snappily
given.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I can manage to row both of
us,” was our hero’s reply.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not fond of the water.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29"><span title="29">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Perhaps you like football or baseball better,”
went on Jack, a little puzzled. “We have a good
eleven.”</p>

<p>“I’m not allowed to play football.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d like to go for a walk,” persisted
Jack, who had the kindest heart in the world, and
who felt sorry for the lonely new boy. “I’ll show
you around. I understand you just came.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I arrived yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to take a walk? I don’t know
but what I’d just as soon do that as row.”</p>

<p>“No, I—I don’t care for walking.”</p>

<p>The lad turned aside and started away from the
lake, without even so much as thanking Jack for
his effort to make friends with him.</p>

<p>“Humph!” mused Jack as he got into his boat.
“You certainly are a queer customer. Just like a
snail, you go in your house and walk off with it.
There’s something wrong about you, and I’m going
to find out what it is. Don’t like rowing, don’t
like walking, afraid of the water—you certainly are
queer.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30"><span title="30">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>BULLY SNAITH</small></h2>


<p>“Hello, Dock, I’m glad to see you out of the
hospital,” remarked Jack one morning about a week
later, when his boating rival was walking down
the campus. “You had quite a time of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Snaith, “I got a nasty bump
on the head. Say, Ranger, I haven’t had a chance
to thank you for pulling me out. I’m much obliged
to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. Don’t mention it,” answered
Jack. “If I hadn’t done it, some one else
would.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you did. But say, I still think
I can beat you rowing. Want to try it again?”</p>

<p>“I won’t mind, when you think you’re well
enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be all right in a day or so.”</p>

<p>“Be careful. You don’t want to overdo yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll beat you next time. But I want to
race for money. What do you say to twenty-five
dollars as a side bet?”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_31" href="#Page_31"><span title="31">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“No, thanks, I don’t bet,” replied Jack quietly.</p>

<p>“Hu! Afraid of losing the money, I s’pose,”
sneered Dock.</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t believe in betting on amateur
sport.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you think you can beat me, why don’t
you bet? It’s a chance to make twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t particularly need the money;
and when I race I like to do it just for the fun that’s
in it.”</p>

<p>“Aw, you’re no sport,” growled Snaith as he
turned aside. “I thought you had some spunk.”</p>

<p>“So I have, but I don’t bet,” replied Jack quickly.
He felt angry at the bully, but did not want to
get into a dispute with him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dock,” called Pud Armstrong, as, walking
along with Glen Forker, he caught sight of
his crony. “How you feeling?”</p>

<p>“Fine, but I’d feel better if there weren’t so
many Sunday-school kids at this institution. I
thought this was a swell place, but it’s a regular
kindergarten,” and he looked meaningly at Jack.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Pud.</p>

<p>“Why, I wanted to make a little wager with
Ranger about rowing him again, but he’s afraid.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that, and you know it,” retorted our
hero quickly, for he overheard what Snaith said.
“And I don’t want you to go about circulating such
a report, either, Dock Snaith.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32"><span title="32">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>With flashing eyes and clenched fists Jack took a
step toward the bully.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I didn’t mean anything,” stammered
Snaith. “You needn’t be so all-fired touchy!”</p>

<p>“I’m not, but I won’t stand for having that said
about me. I’ll race you for fun, and you know it.
Say the word.”</p>

<p>“Well—some other time, maybe,” muttered
Snaith, as he strolled off with his two cronies.</p>

<p>It was that afternoon when Jack, with Nat Anderson,
walking down a path that led to the lake,
came upon a scene that made them stop, and which,
later, was productive of unexpected results.</p>

<p>The two friends saw Dock Snaith, together with
Pud Armstrong and Glen Forker, facing the new
boy, Will Williams. They had him in a corner
of a fence, near the lake, and from the high words
that came to Jack and Nat, it indicated that a
quarrel was in progress.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s that bully, Snaith, making trouble for
the freshman,” replied Jack. “Isn’t it queer he
can’t live one day without being mean? Snaith, I’m
speaking of. He’s a worthy successor to Jerry
Chowden.”</p>

<p>“Well, you polished off Chowden; maybe you
can do the same to Snaith.”</p>

<p>“There’s no question but what I can do it, if
I get the chance. He’s just like Jerry was—always<a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33"><span title="33">&#160;</span></a>
picking on the new boys, or some one smaller
than he is.”</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s see what’s up.”</p>

<p>They did not have to go much closer to overhear
what was being said by Snaith and his cronies
on one side, and Will on the other.</p>

<p>“I say, you new kid, what’s your name?” asked
the bully.</p>

<p>“Yes, speak up, and don’t mumble,” added Pud.</p>

<p>“My name is Williams,” replied the new lad.
“I wish you would let me go.”</p>

<p>“Can’t just yet, sonny,” said Glen. “We are
just making your acquaintance,” and he punched
Will in the stomach, making him double up.</p>

<p>“Hold on, there,” cried Snaith. “I didn’t ask
you to make a bow. Wait until you’re told,” and
he shoved the lad’s head back.</p>

<p>“Now you stop that!” exclaimed Will with
considerable spirit.</p>

<p>“What’s that! Hark to him talking back to
us!” exclaimed Pud. “Now you’ll have to bow
again,” and once more he punched the new boy.</p>

<p>“Please let me alone!” cried Will. “I haven’t
done anything to you.”</p>

<p>“No, but you might,” spoke Snaith. “Have you
been hazed yet?”</p>

<p>“Of course he hasn’t,” added Glen. “He came
in late, and he hasn’t been initiated. I guess it’s
time to do it.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34"><span title="34">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Sure it is,” agreed the bully with a grin. “Let’s
see—we’ll give him the water cure.”</p>

<p>“That’s it! Toss him in the lake and watch
him swim out!” added Pud. “Come on, Glen,
catch hold!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Please don’t!” begged Will.</p>

<p>“Aw, dry up! What you howling about?” asked
Pud. “Every new boy has to be hazed, and you’re
getting off easy. A bath will do you good. Let’s
take him down to the float. It’s real deep there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! No! Please don’t! Anything but
that!” begged Will. “I—I can’t swim.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s time you learned,” said Snaith with
a brutal laugh. “Catch hold of his other leg,
Pud.”</p>

<p>They quickly made a grab for the unfortunate
lad, and, despite his struggles, carried him toward
the lake. It was not an uncommon form of hazing,
but it was usually done when a crowd was present,
and the hazing committee always took care to find
out that the candidates could swim. In addition,
there were always lads ready to go to the rescue
in case of accident. But this was entirely different.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t! Please don’t!” begged Will. “I—I
don’t want to go in the water. Do anything but
that.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him cry!” mocked Glen. “Hasn’t he
got a sweet voice?”</p>

<p>Nearer to the lake approached the three bullies<a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35"><span title="35">&#160;</span></a>
and their victim, who was struggling to escape. He
was pleading piteously.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this,” murmured Jack. “Williams
is afraid of water. He told me so. It’s probably
a nervous dread, and if they throw him in he may
go into a spasm and drown. They should do
something else if they want to haze him.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Nat. He
and his chum were hidden from the others by a
clump of trees.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make Snaith stop!” said Jack determinedly
as he strode forward with flashing eyes.
“You wait here, Nat.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36"><span title="36">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>A GERMAN-FRENCH ALLIANCE</small></h2>


<p>“Oh, fellows, please let go! Don’t throw me
in the lake! I—I can’t swim!”</p>

<p>It was Will’s final appeal.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s time you learned,” exclaimed Snaith
with a laugh. “Come on now, boys, take it on
the run!”</p>

<p>But at that moment Jack Ranger fairly leaped
from behind the clump of trees where he and Nat
Anderson stood, and running after the three mean
lads who were carrying the struggling Will, our
hero planted himself in front of them.</p>

<p>“Here—drop him!” he cried, barring their way.</p>

<p>Surprise at Jack’s sudden appearance, no less
than at his words and bearing, brought the hazers
to a stop.</p>

<p>“What—what’s that you said?” asked Snaith,
as if disbelieving the evidence of his ears.</p>

<p>“I said to drop this, and let Williams go.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Pud.</p>

<p>“For several reasons. He can’t swim, and he
has a nervous dread of the water, as I happen to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37"><span title="37">&#160;</span></a>
know. Besides, it’s too chilly to throw any one in
the lake now.”</p>

<p>“Are those all your reasons?” asked Snaith with
a sneer.</p>

<p>“No!” cried Jack. “If you want another, it’s
because I tell you to stop!”</p>

<p>“S’posing we don’t?”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will, eh? Well, I guess we three can
take care of you, all right, even if you are Jack
Ranger.”</p>

<p>Snaith had a tight hold on Will’s arm. The
timid lad had been set down by his captors, but
they still had hold of him.</p>

<p>“Please let me go,” pleaded Williams.</p>

<p>“We will—after you’ve had your dip in the
lake,” said Glen.</p>

<p>“Yes, come on,” added Snaith. “Get out of
the way, Ranger, if you don’t want to get bumped.”</p>

<p>“You let Williams go!” demanded Jack, still
barring the way.</p>

<p>“We’ll not! Stand aside or I’ll hit you!”
snapped Snaith.</p>

<p>He and his cronies again picked Williams up,
and were advancing with him toward the lake.
Snaith had one hand free, and as he approached
Jack, who had not moved, the bully struck out at
him. The blow landed lightly on Jack’s chest,
but the next instant his fist shot out, catching Snaith<a class="pagenum" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38"><span title="38">&#160;</span></a>
under the ear, and the bully suddenly toppled over
backward, measuring his length on the ground.</p>

    <p class="caption">“JACK’S FIST SHOT OUT, CATCHING SNAITH UNDER THE EAR.”</p>
</div>

<p>He was up again in a second, however, and
spluttered out:</p>

<p>“Wha—what do you mean? I’ll fix you for
this! I’ll make you pay for that, Jack Ranger!”</p>

<p>“Whenever you like,” replied Jack coolly, as he
stood waiting the attack.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows, let’s do him up!” cried Pud.
“We’re three to one, and I owe him something on
my own account.”</p>

<p>“Shall we let the freshman go?” asked Glen.</p>

<p>“Sure!” exclaimed Snaith. “We can catch him
again. We’ll do up Ranger now!”</p>

<p>The bully and his cronies advanced toward Jack.
Will, hardly understanding that he was released,
stood still, though Jack called to him:</p>

<p>“Better run, youngster. I can look out for myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can, eh?” sneered Snaith. “Well, I
guess you’ll have your hands full. Come on, now,
fellows! Give it to him!”</p>

<p>The three advanced with the intention of administering
a sound drubbing to our hero, and it
is more than likely that they would have succeeded,
for Jack could not tackle three at once very
well. But something happened.</p>

<p>This “something” was a lad who came bounding
up from the rear, with a roar like a small, maddened<a class="pagenum" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39"><span title="39">&#160;</span></a>
bull, and then with a cry Nat Anderson flung
himself on the back of Pud Armstrong.</p>

<p>“Flabgastered punching-bags!” he cried.
“Three to one, eh? Well, I guess not! Acrimonious
Abercrombie! But I’ll take a hand in this
game!”</p>

<p>“Here! Quit that! Let me go! Stop! That’s
no way to fight! Get off my back!” yelled the
startled Pud.</p>

<p>“I’m not fighting yet,” said Nat coolly, as he
skillfully locked his legs in those of Pud and sent
him to the ground with a wrestler’s trick. “I’m
only getting ready to wallop you!”</p>

<p>Snaith, who had rushed at Jack with raised fists,
was met by another left-hander that again sent him
to the ground. And then, to the surprise of the
rescuers, no less than that of the would-be hazers,
Will, who had seemed so timid in the hands of
his captors, rushed at Glen Forker, and before that
bully could get out of the way, had dealt him a
blow on the chest.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Will. “I guess we’re three to
three now!”</p>

<p>“Good for you, youngster!” cried Jack heartily.
“You’ve got more spunk than I gave you credit for.
Hit him again!”</p>

<p>“Now, Pud, if you’ll get up, you and I will
have our innings,” announced Nat to the lad he<a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40"><span title="40">&#160;</span></a>
had thrown. “Suffering snufflebugs! but I guess
the game isn’t so one-sided now.”</p>

<p>But, though Pud got up, he evinced no desire
to come to close quarters with Nat. Instead, he
sneaked to one side, muttering:</p>

<p>“You wait—that’s all! You just wait!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a pretty good waiter. I used to
work in a hash foundry and a beanery,” said Nat
with a smile.</p>

<p>Snaith, too, seemed to have had enough, for he
sat on the ground rubbing a lump on his head,
while as for Glen, he was in full retreat.</p>

<p>“I hope I didn’t hurt you, Snaith,” said Jack
politely.</p>

<p>“Don’t you speak to me!” snarled the bully.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack. “I’ll not.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get square with you for this,” went on
Snaith as he arose and began to retreat, followed
by Pud. “You wait!”</p>

<p>“That’s what Pud said,” interjected Nat. “It’s
getting tiresome.”</p>

<p>The two bullies hurried off in the direction taken
by Glen, leaving Jack, Nat and Will masters of
the field.</p>

<p>“I—I’m ever so much obliged to you,” said Will
to Jack after a pause.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Glad I happened along.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t mind being hazed,” went on the
timid lad. “I expected it, but I have a weak heart,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41"><span title="41">&#160;</span></a>
and the doctor said a sudden shock would be bad
for me. I’m very much afraid of water, and I can’t
swim, or I wouldn’t have minded being thrown
into the lake. I—I hope you don’t think I’m a
coward.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it.”</p>

<p>“And I—I hope the fellows won’t make fun of
me.”</p>

<p>“They won’t,” said Jack very positively, for,
somehow, his heart went out to the queer lad. “If
they do, just send them to me. As for Snaith and
his crowd, I guess they won’t bother you after this.
Say, but you went right up to Glen, all right.”</p>

<p>“I took boxing lessons—once,” went on Will
timidly. “I’m not afraid in a fair fight.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it, but I fancy they’ll not bother
you any more. Do you know Nat Anderson?” and
Jack nodded at his chum.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to meet you,” spoke Will, holding out
his hand.</p>

<p>“Same here,” responded Nat. “Unified uppercuts!
but you went at Glen good and proper!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind Nat’s queer expressions,”
said Jack with a smile, as he saw Will looking in
rather a puzzled way at Nat. “They were vaccinated
in him, and he can’t get rid of them.”</p>

<p>“You get out!” exclaimed Jack’s chum.</p>

<p>“Going anywhere in particular?” asked Jack of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42"><span title="42">&#160;</span></a>
Will, as he straightened out a cuff that had become
disarranged in the scrimmage.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not.”</p>

<p>“Then come on and take a walk with us.”</p>

<p>The lad appeared to hesitate. Then he said
slowly.</p>

<p>“No—no, thank you. I—I don’t believe I
will. I think I’ll go back to my room.”</p>

<p>He turned aside and walked away.</p>

<p>Jack and Nat stared after him in silence.</p>

<p>“Well, he certainly is a queer case,” remarked
Nat in a low voice. “I don’t know what to make
of him.”</p>

<p>“I, either,” admitted Jack. “He showed some
spunk when he went at Glen, but now it appears
to have oozed away.”</p>

<p>The two chums continued their walk, discussing
the recent happening.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I think something is about due
to happen, fellows,” announced Fred Kaler that
night, when he and some of Jack’s and Nat’s
chums were in the latters’ room.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s up, you animated jewsharp?”
asked Nat.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it’s been so quiet in the sacred
precincts of our school lately that it’s about time
for something to arrive. Do you know that Socrat
and Garlach haven’t spoken to each other this
term yet?”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43"><span title="43">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“What’s the trouble now?” asked Jack, for the
French and German teachers, with the characteristics
of their race, were generally at swords’ points
for some reason or other.</p>

<p>“Why, you know their classrooms are next to
each other, and one day, the first week of the term,
Professor Socrat, in giving the French lesson,
touched on history, and gave an instance of where
frog-eaters with a small army had downed the
troops from <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">der Vaterland</span>. He spoke so loud that
Professor Garlach heard him, his German blood
boiled over, and since then neither has spoken to
the other.”</p>

<p>“Well, that often happens,” remarked Nat.</p>

<p>“Sure,” added Bony Balmore, cracking his finger
knuckles by way of practice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Fred, as he took out his mouth-organ,
preparatory to rendering a tune, “but this
time it has lasted longer than usual, and it’s about
time something was done about it.”</p>

<p>Fred began softly to play “On the Banks of the
Wabash Far Away.”</p>

<p>“Cheese it,” advised Nat. “Martin will hear.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone to the village on an errand for the
doctor,” said Fred as he continued to play. Then
he stopped long enough to remark: “I’d like to
hear from our fellow member, Jack Ranger.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” exclaimed Sam Chalmers. “I wonder
Jack hasn’t suggested something before this.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44"><span title="44">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed Jack, “have I got to do everything
around this school? Why don’t some of the
rest of you think up something? I haven’t any
monopoly.”</p>

<p>“No, but you’ve got the nerve,” said Bony.
“Say, Jack, can’t you think of some scheme for
getting Garlach and Socrat to speak? Once they
are on talking terms we can have some fun.”</p>

<p>Jack seemed lost in thought. Then he began
to pace the room.</p>

<p>“Our noble leader has his thinking apparatus
in working order,” announced Nat.</p>

<p>“Hum!” mused Jack. “You say the trouble
occurred over something in history, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Fred.</p>

<p>“Then I guess I’ve got it!” cried Jack. “Wait a
minute, now, until I work out all the details.”</p>

<p>He sat down to the table, took out pencil and
paper, and began to write. The others watched
him interestedly.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” Jack cried at length. “Now
to carry out the scheme and bring about a German-French
alliance!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Here are two notes,” said Jack, holding aloft
two envelopes.</p>

<p>“We’ll take your word for it,” remarked Bob
Movel.</p>

<p>“One is addressed to Professor Garlach,” went<a class="pagenum" id="Page_45" href="#Page_45"><span title="45">&#160;</span></a>
on Jack, “and in it he is advised that if he proceeds
in the proper manner he can obtain information
of a certain incident in history, not generally
known, but in which is related how Frederic&#160;II,
with a small squad of Germans, put a whole
army of French to flight. It is even more wonderful
than the incident which Professor Socrat related
to his class, and if he speaks loudly enough in the
classroom, Professor Socrat can’t help but hear
it.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the note?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“Send it to Garlach.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes—then,” said Jack. “Well, what will
happen next will surprise some folks, I think. The
information which Garlach will be sure to want
to obtain can only be had by going to a certain
hollow tree, on the shore of the lake, and he must
go there just at midnight.”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Dick Balmore as Jack paused,
while the silence in the room was broken by Bony’s
performance on his finger battery.</p>

<p>“Well,” repeated Jack, “what happens then will
be continued in our next, as the novelists say. Now
come on and help me fix it up,” and he motioned
for his chums to draw more closely around the
table, while he imparted something to them in
guarded whispers.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46"><span title="46">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>A SNOWSTORM</small></h2>


<p>Professor Garlach received the next day a
neatly-written note. It was thrust under the door
of his private apartment, just as he was getting
ready to go to breakfast.</p>

<p>“<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach!</span> Dis is a letter,” he said, carefully looking
at the envelope, as if there was some doubt of
it. “I vunder who can haf sent it to me?”</p>

<p>He turned it over several times, but seeing no
way of learning what he wished to know save by
opening the epistle, he did so.</p>

<p>“Vot is dis?” he murmured as he read. “Ha!
dot is der best news vot I haf heard in a long time.
<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach!</span> now I gets me efen mid dot <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">wienerwurst</span> of
a Socrat! I vill vanquishes him!”</p>

<p>This is what the German professor read:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I am a lover of the Fatherland, and I understand
that an insult has been offered her glory by
a Frenchman who is a professor in the same school
where you teach. I understand that he said a small
body of the despised French beat a large army of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47"><span title="47">&#160;</span></a>
Germans. This is not true, but I am in a position
to prove the contrary, namely, that in the Hanoverian
or Seven Years’ War, in 1756, a small
troop of Germans, under Frederic&#160;II, defeated a
large army of the French. The incident is little
known in history, but I have all the facts at hand,
and I will give them to you.</p>

<p>“The information is secret, and I cannot reveal
to you my name, or I might get into trouble with
the German war authorities, so I will have to ask
you to proceed cautiously. I will deposit the proofs
of what I say in the hollow of the old oak tree that
stands near the shore of the lake, not far from
the school. If you will go there at midnight to-night,
you may take the papers away and demonstrate
to your classes that the Germans are always
the superiors of the French in war. I must beg
of you to say nothing about this to any one. Proceed
in secret, and you will be able to refute the
base charges made against our countrymen by a
base Frenchman. Do not fail. Be at the old tree
at midnight. For obvious reasons I sign myself
only</p>

<p class="signature">“<span class="smcap">Bismark.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Professor Garlach. “I vill do
as you direct. T’anks, mine unknown frient!
T’anks! Now vill I make to der utmost confusionability
dot frog-eater of a Socrat! Ha! ve
shall see. I vill be on der spot at midnight!”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48"><span title="48">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>All that day there might have been noticed that
there was a subdued excitement hovering about
Professor Garlach. Jack and his chums observing
it, smiled.</p>

<p>“He’s taken the bait, hook and sinker,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>When the class in history was called before him
to recite, Professor Garlach remarked:</p>

<p>“Young gentlemens, I shall have some surprising
informations to impart by you to-morrow. I am
about to come into possession of some remarkable
facts, but I cannot reveal dem to you now. But
I vill say dot dey vill simply astonishment to you
make alretty yet. You are dismissed.”</p>

<p>He had spoken quite loudly, and Professor
Socrat, in the next room, hearing him, smiled.</p>

<p>“Ah,” murmured the Frenchman, “so my unknown
friend, who was so kind as to write zis note,
did not deceive me. <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sacre!</span> But I will bring his
plans to nottingness! Ah, beware, Professor Garlach—pig-dog
zat you are! I will foil you. But
let me read ze note once more.”</p>

<p>Alone in the classroom, he took from his pocket
a letter. It looked just like the one professor Garlach
had received that morning.</p>

<p>“Ha, yes. I am not mistake! I will be at ze
old oak tree on ze shore of ze lake at midnight by
ze clock. And I will catch in ze act Professor<a class="pagenum" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49"><span title="49">&#160;</span></a>
Garlach when he make ze attempt to blow up zat
sacred tree. Zat tree under which La&#160;Fayette once
slept. Queer zat I did not know it before. Ha!
I will drape ze flag of France on ze beloved
branches. Ah! my beloved country!”</p>

<p>For this is the note which Professor Socrat received:</p>

<blockquote><p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Professor:</span> This is written by a true
friend of France, who is not at liberty to reveal his
name. I have information to the effect that the
old oak tree which stands on the shore of the lake
is a landmark in history. Under it, during the
American war of independence, the immortal
Washington and La&#160;Fayette once slept before a
great battle, when their tents had not arrived. The
tree should be honored by all Frenchmen, as well
as by all Americans.</p>

<p>“But, though it is not generally known that La&#160;Fayette
slept under the tree, Professor Garlach
has learned of it in some way. Such is his hatred
of all things French, as you well know, that he
has planned to destroy the tree. At midnight to-night
he is going to put a dynamite bomb in the
tree, and blow it to atoms. He hopes the plot
will be laid to the students. If you wish to foil
him be at the tree at midnight. I will sign myself
only</p>

<p class="signature">“<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50"><span title="50">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Ha! destroy zat sacred tree by dynamite!”
murmured Professor Socrat. “I will be zere! I
will be zere!”</p>

<p>It lacked some time before twelve o’clock that
night, when several figures stole out of a dormitory
of Washington Hall.</p>

<p>“Have you got everything, Jack?” asked a voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; but for cats’ sake, keep quiet,” was the
rejoinder. “Come on now. Lucky Martin didn’t
spot us.”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” added Nat Anderson. “Scouring
sky-rockets, but there’ll be some fun!”</p>

<p>“Easy!” cautioned Jack as he led a band of
fellow conspirators toward the lake.</p>

<p>They reached the old, hollow oak tree, of which
Jack had spoken in his two letters to the professors,
and which he had made the rendezvous for his
joke. Into the hollow he thrust a bundle of papers.
Then, some distance away from the tree, he stuck
something else upright in the ground, and trailing
off from it were what seemed to be twisted strings.</p>

<p>“Lucky it’s a dark night,” whispered Bony.
“They won’t see each other until they get right
here. What time is it now?”</p>

<p>“Lacks a quarter of twelve,” replied Jack, striking
a match and shielding it from observation under
the flap of his coat as he looked at his watch.</p>

<p>The boys crouched down in the bushes and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_51" href="#Page_51"><span title="51">&#160;</span></a>
waited. It was not long before they heard some
one approaching in the darkness.</p>

<p>“That’s Garlach by the way he walks,” whispered
Bob Movel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Jack. “I hope Socrat is on
time.”</p>

<p>The German professor approached the tree,
anxious to take from it the papers that were to
prove the valor of German soldiers. A moment
later another figure loomed up in the darkness on
the other side of the big trunk.</p>

<p>“There’s Socrat,” whispered Nat. “But what
is he carrying?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know,” answered Jack; “but we’ll
soon see.”</p>

<p>He struck a match and touched it to the end of
the twisted strings. There was a splutter of flame,
and some sparks ran along the ground. A moment
later the scene was lighted up by glaring red fire,
the fuse of which Jack had touched off. By the
illumination the boys hidden in the bushes could
see Professor Garlach, with his hand and arm down
the hollow of the old oak tree. At the same time
Professor Socrat rushed forward, and what he
had in his hand was a pail of water.</p>

<p>“So!” cried the Frenchman. “I have caught
you in ze act! I will foil you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t bodder me!” cried the German. “<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach!</span>
You would steal der evidence of your countrymen’s<a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52"><span title="52">&#160;</span></a>
cowardice, vould you? But you shall not! I vill
haf my revenge!”</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” cried Professor Socrat. “You
shall not destroy ze tree under which ze immortal
Washington and La&#160;Fayette slept! You shall not!
I, Professor Socrat, say it! Ha! you have already
lighted ze dynamite fuse! But I will destroy it!”</p>

<p>Professor Garlach drew from the tree the bundle
of papers. No sooner had he done so than Professor
Socrat dashed the pail of water over him,
drenching him from head to foot.</p>

<p>“<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Du meine zeit! Himmel! Hund</span> vot you are!
I am drowning!” cried the German, choking.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! I have put out ze fuse! I have
quenched ze dynamite cartridge! Ze tree shall not
be blown to atoms! I will drape it wiz my country’s
flag.”</p>

<p>From his coat the French professor drew the
tri-colored flag, which he draped over the lowest
branches of the old tree. Then, as the red fire
died out, the boys saw the German make a spring
for his enemy.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows!” softly called Jack. “We’d
better skip while they’re at one another.”</p>

<p>They glided from the bushes, while at the foot
of the tree, in the dying glow from the red fire,
could be seen two shapes struggling desperately
together. From the midst came such alternate
expressions as:</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53"><span title="53">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach!</span> Pig-dog! Frog-eater! Sauerkraut!
Maccaroni! <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Himmel!</span> <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sacre!</span> La&#160;Fayette!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but aren’t they having a grand time!” said
Nat as he hurried along at Jack’s side. “It worked
like a charm. But who would have thought that
Socrat would have brought along a pail of water?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have been better,” admitted Jack, “if
I do say it myself.”</p>

<p>“But won’t they find out who did it?” asked
Bony.</p>

<p>“They may suspect, but they’ll never know for
sure,” said the perpetrator of the trick.</p>

<p>“How about the bundle of papers you left in
the tree?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but newspapers, and they can’t talk.
But I guess we’ve livened things up some. Anyhow,
they’ve spoken to each other.”</p>

<p>“They sure have,” admitted Sam, as from the
darkness, at the foot of the tree, came the sounds
of voices in high dispute.</p>

<p>The next day Professor Socrat passed Professor
Garlach without so much as a look in the direction
of the German, but when he got past he muttered:</p>

<p>“Ze La&#160;Fayette tree still stands.”</p>

<p>And Professor Garlach replied:</p>

<p>“Pig-dog vot you are! To destroy dot secret
of history!”</p>

<p>Jack and his chums awaited rather anxiously
the calling of the French and German classes that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54"><span title="54">&#160;</span></a>
day, but neither professor made any reference to
the happenings of the night previous. All there
was to remind a passer-by of it were some shreds
of a French flag hanging to the limbs of the tree.</p>

<p>“They must have ripped the flag apart in their
struggle with each other,” said Sam as he and Jack
passed the place.</p>

<p>Matters at Washington Hall went on the even
tenor of their ways for about two weeks. The
boys buckled down to study, though there was
plenty of time for sport, and the football eleven,
of which Jack was a member, played several games.</p>

<p>The weather was getting cold and snappy, and
there were signs of an early and severe winter.
These signs were borne out one morning when Jack
crawled out of bed.</p>

<p>“Whew! but it’s cold!” he said as he pulled
aside the window curtains and looked out. Then
he uttered an exclamation. “Say, Nat, it’s snowing
to beat the band!”</p>

<p>“Snowing?”</p>

<p>“Sure, and I’ve got to go to the village this
afternoon. Look!”</p>

<p>Nat crawled out, shivering, and stood beside
Jack.</p>

<p>“Why, it is quite a storm,” he admitted.
“B-r-r-r-r! I’m going to get my flannels out!”</p>

<p>“No football game to-morrow,” said Jack. “I
guess winter’s come to stay.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55"><span title="55">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>A STRANGE CONFESSION</small></h2>


<p>“Say, Jack,” began Nat at breakfast a little
later, “what are you going to the village for?”</p>

<p>“Got to get something Aunt Angelina sent me,”
replied our hero. “I got a letter saying she had
forwarded me a package by express. It’s got some
heavy underwear in it for one thing, but I know
enough of my aunt to know that’s not all that’s in
it.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“Well, I shouldn’t be surprised if there were
some pies and doughnuts and cakes and——”</p>

<p>“Quit!” begged Bony, who sat on the other side
of Jack. “You make me hungry.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with this grub?” inquired
Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right as far as it goes——”</p>

<p>“Smithering slaboleens!” exclaimed Nat.
“Doesn’t it go far enough in you, Bony?” and he
looked at his tall chum. “Do you want it to go
all the way to your toes?”</p>

<p>“No; but when I hear Jack speak of pies and
doughnuts——”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56"><span title="56">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“You’ll do more than hear me speak of them
if they come, Bony,” went on Jack. “We’ll have
a little feast in my room to-night, when Martin,
the monitor, is gone to bed.”</p>

<p>“When are you going?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Right after dinner. Want to come along? I
guess you can get permission. I did.”</p>

<p>“Nope. I’ve got to stay here and bone up on
geometry. I flunked twice this week, and Doc.
Mead says I’ve got to do better. Take Bony.”</p>

<p>“Not for mine,” said Bony, shivering as he
looked out of the window and saw the snow still
coming down. “I’m going to stay in.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go alone,” decided Jack, and he
started off soon after the midday meal. The storm
was not a severe one, though it was cold and the
snow was quite heavy. It was a good three-mile
walk to the village, but Jack had often taken it.</p>

<p>He was about a mile from the school, and was
swinging along the country road, thinking of many
things, when, through the white blanket of snowflakes,
he saw a figure just ahead of him on the
highway.</p>

<p>“That looks familiar,” he said to himself.
“That’s Will Williams. Wonder what he can be
doing out here? Guess he’s going to town also.
I’ll catch up with him. I wish I could get better
acquainted with him, but he goes in his shell as
soon as I try to make friends.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57"><span title="57">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>He hastened his pace, but it was slow going on
account of the snow. When Jack was about a hundred
yards behind Will he was surprised to see the
odd student suddenly turn off the main road and
make toward a chain of small hills that bordered
it on the right.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” murmured Jack. “I wonder
what he’s doing that for?”</p>

<p>He stood still a moment, looking at Will. The
new boy kept on, plodding through the snow,
which lay in heavy drifts over the unbroken path
he was taking.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s heading for the ravine,” said Jack
to himself. “He’ll be lost if he goes there in this
storm, and it’s dangerous. He may fall down the
chasm and break an arm or a leg.”</p>

<p>The ravine he referred to was a deep gully in
the hills, a wild, desolate sort of place, seldom
visited. It was in the midst of thick woods, and
more than once solitary travelers had lost their
way there, while one or two, unfamiliar with the
<del class="correction">suddeness</del><ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has “suddeness”">suddenness</ins>
with which the chasm dipped down, had
fallen and been severely hurt.</p>

<p>“What in the world can he want out there?”
went on Jack. “I’d better hail him. Guess he
doesn’t know the danger, especially in a storm like
this, when bad holes are likely to be hidden from
sight.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58"><span title="58">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>He hurried forward, and then, making a sort of
megaphone of his hands, called out:</p>

<p>“Williams! I say, Williams, where are you
going?”</p>

<p>The new boy turned quickly, looked back at
Jack, and then continued his journey.</p>

<p>“Hey! Come back!” yelled our hero. “You’ll
be lost if you go up in those hills. It’s dangerous!
Come on back!”</p>

<p>Williams stopped again, and turned half around.</p>

<p>“Guess he didn’t hear me plainly,” thought Jack.
“I’ll catch up to him. Wait a minute,” he called
again, and he hastened forward, Will waiting for
him.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Jack, when he
had caught up to him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the answer, and Jack was
struck by the lad’s despondent tone.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know there’s a dangerous ravine
just ahead here?” went on Jack. “You might tumble
in and lose your life.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I do lose my life,” was the unexpected
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“You don’t care?” repeated Jack, much surprised.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you realize what you’re saying?” asked
Jack sternly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I don’t care! I want to be lost!<a class="pagenum" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59"><span title="59">&#160;</span></a>
I never want to see any one again! I came out
here—I don’t care what becomes of me—I’d like
to fall down under the snow and—and die—that
would end it all!”</p>

<p>Then, to Jack’s astonishment, Will burst into
tears, though he bravely tried to stifle them.</p>

<p>“Well—of all the——” began Jack, and words
failed him. Clearly he had a most peculiar case
to deal with. He took a step nearer, and put his
arm affectionately around Will’s shoulder. Then
he patted him on the back, and his own voice was a
trifle husky as he said:</p>

<p>“Say, old man, what’s the matter? Own up,
now, you’re in trouble. Maybe I can help you.
It doesn’t take half an eye to see that’s something’s
wrong. The idea of a chap like you wanting to
die! It’s nonsense. You must be sick. Brace up,
now! Tell me all about it. Maybe I can help
you.”</p>

<p>There was silence, broken only by Will’s half-choked
sobs.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, tell me,” urged Jack. “I’ll keep
your secret, and help you if I can. Tell me what
the trouble is.”</p>

<p>“I will!” exclaimed the new boy with sudden
determination. “I will tell you, Jack Ranger, but
I don’t think you can help me. I’m the most miserable
lad at Washington Hall.”</p>

<p>“You only think so,” rejoined Jack brightly.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60"><span title="60">&#160;</span></a>
“Go ahead. I’ll wager we can make you feel better.
You want some friends, that’s what you want.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Will slowly, “I do. I need friends,
for I don’t believe I’ve got a single one in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got one, and that’s me,” went
on Jack. “Go ahead, now, let’s hear your story.”</p>

<p>And then, standing in the midst of the storm,
Will told his pitiful tale.</p>

<p>“My father and mother have been dead for
some time,” he said, “and for several years I lived
with my uncle, Andrew Swaim, my mother’s
brother. He was good to me, but he had to go out
West on business, and he left me in charge of a
man named Lewis Gabel, who was appointed my
guardian.</p>

<p>“This Gabel treated me pretty good at first,
for my uncle sent money regularly for my board.
Then, for some reason, the money stopped coming,
and Mr.&#160;Gabel turned mean. He hardly gave
me enough to eat, and I had to work like a horse
on his farm. I wrote to my uncle, but I never
got an answer.</p>

<p>“Then, all at once, my uncle began sending
money again, but he didn’t state where he was.
After that I had it a little easier, until some one
stole quite a sum from Mr.&#160;Gabel. He’s a regular
miser, and he loves money more than anything else.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61"><span title="61">&#160;</span></a>
He accused me of robbing him, and declared he
wouldn’t have me around his house any longer.</p>

<p>“So he sent me off to this school, but he doesn’t
give me a cent of spending money, and pays all
the bills himself. He still thinks I stole his money,
and he says he will hold back my spending cash,
which my uncle forwards, until he has made up the
amount that was stolen.</p>

<p>“I tried to prove to him that I was innocent,
but he won’t believe me. He is always writing me
mean letters, reminding me that I am a thief, and
not fit for decent people to associate with. I’m
miserable, and I wish I was dead. I got a mean,
accusing letter from him to-day, and it made me
feel so bad that I didn’t care what became of me.
I wandered off, and I thought if I fell down and
died under the snow it would be a good thing.”</p>

<p>“Say, you certainly are up against it,” murmured
Jack. “I’d like to get hold of that rascally guardian
of yours. But why don’t you tell your uncle?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, for I don’t know his address.”</p>

<p>“But he sends money for your schooling and
board to Mr.&#160;Gabel, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he sends cash in a letter, and he doesn’t
even register it. I wrote to the postal authorities
of the Western city where his letters were mailed,
but they said they could give me no information.”</p>

<p>“What is your uncle doing in the West?”</p>

<p>“He is engaged in some secret mission. I never<a class="pagenum" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62"><span title="62">&#160;</span></a>
could find out what it is, and I don’t believe Mr.&#160;Gabel
knows, either. Oh, but Gabel is a mean
man! He seems to take delight in making me
miserable. Now you know why I act so queerly.
I like a good time, and I like to be with the fellows,
but I haven’t a cent to spend to treat them
with, and I’m not going to accept favors that I
can’t return. Why, I haven’t had a cent to spend
for myself in six months!”</p>

<p>Jack whistled.</p>

<p>“That’s tough,” he said. “But say, Will, you’re
mistaken if you think our crowd cares anything for
money. Why didn’t you say something about this
before?”</p>

<p>“I—I was ashamed to.”</p>

<p>“Why, we thought you didn’t like us,” went on
Jack. “Now I see that we were mistaken. I wish
we had Mr.&#160;Gabel here. We’d haze him first,
and throw him into the lake afterward. Now,
Will, I’ll tell you what you’re going to do?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the lad, who seemed much better
in spirits, now that he had made a confession.</p>

<p>“In the first place, you’re coming to the village
with me,” said Jack. “Then you’re going to forget
all about your troubles and about dying under the
snow. Then, when I get a bundle from home,
you’re coming back with me, and——”</p>

<p>“Home!” exclaimed Will with a catch in his
voice. “How good that word sounds! I—I<a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63"><span title="63">&#160;</span></a>
haven’t had a home in so long that—that I don’t
know what it seems like.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to make you right at home
here,” went on Jack. “I’m expecting a bundle of
good things from my aunt, and when it comes, why,
you and me and Nat and Sam and Bony and Fred
and Bob, and some other choice spirits, are going
to gather in my room to-night, and we’re going to
have the finest spread you ever saw. I’ll make you
acquainted with the boys, and then we’ll see what
happens. No spending money? As if we cared
for that! Now, come on, old chap, we’ll leg it to
the village, for it’s cold standing here,” and clapping
Will on the back, Jack linked his arm in that
of the new boy and led him back to the road.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64"><span title="64">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE MIDNIGHT FEAST</small></h2>


<p>“Well, fellows, are we all here?” asked Jack
Ranger later that night, as he gazed around on a
crowd in his room.</p>

<p>“If there were any more we couldn’t breathe,”
replied Bony Balmore, and the cracking of his finger
knuckles punctuated his remark.</p>

<p>“When does the fun begin?” asked Bob Movel.</p>

<p>“Soon,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“We ought to have some music. Tune up,
Fred,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Not here,” interposed Jack quickly. “Wait a
bit and we can make all the noise we want to.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” inquired Bony. “Have you
hypnotized Dr.&#160;Mead and put wax in Martin’s
ears so he can’t hear us?”</p>

<p>“No, but it’s something just as good. This
afternoon I sat and listened while Socker, the
janitor, told me one of his war stories.”</p>

<p>“You must have had patience,” interrupted Nat
Anderson. “Bob cats and bombshells, but Socker
is tiresome!”</p>

<p>“Well, I had an object in it,” explained Jack.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65"><span title="65">&#160;</span></a>
“I wanted him to do me a favor, and he did it—after
I’d let him tell me how, single-handed, he
captured a lot of Confederates. I told him about
this spread to-night, and was lamenting the fact
that my room was so small, and that we couldn’t
make any noise, or have any lights. And you know
how awkward it is to eat in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” admitted Bony. “You can’t always find
your mouth.”</p>

<p>“And if there’s anything I dislike,” added Nat,
“it’s putting pie in my ear.”</p>

<p>“Easy!” cautioned Jack at the laugh which followed.
“Wait a few minutes and we can make all
the noise we want to.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Bony.</p>

<p>“Because, as I’m trying to tell you, Socker did
me a favor. He’s going to let us in the storeroom,
back of where the boiler is, in the basement. It’ll
be nice and warm there, and we can have our midnight
feast in comfort, and make all the row we
like, for Martin can’t hear us there.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Jack!” cried Nat.</p>

<p>“That’s all to the horse radish!” observed Sam.</p>

<p>Jack’s trip to town that afternoon had been most
successful. He had found at the express office a
big package from home, and from the note that
accompanied it he knew it contained good things
to eat, made by his loving aunts. But, desiring to
give an unusually fine spread to celebrate the occasion<a class="pagenum" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66"><span title="66">&#160;</span></a>
of having made the acquaintance of Will
Williams, Jack purchased some other good things
at the village stores.</p>

<p>He and Will carried them back to school, and
managed to smuggle them in. It was a new experience
for Will to have a friend like Jack Ranger,
and to be taking part in this daring but harmless
breach of the school rules. Under this stimulus
Will was fast losing his melancholy mood, and he
responded brightly to Jack’s jokes.</p>

<p>“Now you stay in your room until I call for
you,” our hero had said to Will on parting after
supper that night. Jack wanted to spring a sort
of surprise on his chums, and introduce Will to
them at the feast. In accordance with his instructions
the lads had gathered in his room about ten
o’clock that night, stealing softly in after Martin,
the monitor, had made his last round to see that
lights were out. Then Jack had announced his
plan of having the feast in the basement.</p>

<p>“Grab up the grub and come on,” said the leader
a little later. “Softly now—no noise until we’re
downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Will Socker keep mum?” asked Bony.</p>

<p>“As an oyster in a church sociable stew,” replied
Jack. “I’ve promised to listen to another of his
war tales.”</p>

<p>“Jack’s getting to be a regular martyr,” observed
Sam.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67"><span title="67">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Silence in the ranks!” commanded Captain
Jack.</p>

<p>The lads stole softly along the corridors. Just
as they got opposite the door of Martin’s room,
there was a dull thud.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” whispered Jack softly.</p>

<p>“I—I dropped one of the pies,” replied Bony,
cracking his knuckles at the double-quick in his excitement.</p>

<p>“Scoop it up and come on. You’ll have to eat
it,” said Jack.</p>

<p>In fear and trembling they went on. Fortunately,
Martin did not hear the noise, and the lads
got safely past.</p>

<p>Jack, who was in the rear, paused at a door at
the end of the hall, and knocked softly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered a voice from within.</p>

<p>“Come on,” commanded Jack, and he was joined
by a dark figure.</p>

<p>They reached the basement safely, no one having
disputed their night march. Socker, the janitor,
met them at the door of the boiler-room.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“So I see, Mr.&#160;Ranger. Why, it reminds me
of the time when Captain Crawford and me took
a forced night march of ten miles to get some
rations. We were with Sherman, on his trip to
the sea, and——”</p>

<p>“You must be sure to tell me that story,” interrupted<a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" href="#Page_68"><span title="68">&#160;</span></a>
Jack. “But not now. Is everything
all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr.&#160;Ranger. But I depend on you not to
say anything about this to Dr.&#160;Mead in case——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can depend on us,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p>“I thought I could. It reminds me of the time
when we were before Petersburgh, and a comrade
and I went to——”</p>

<p>“You must not forget to tell me that story,” interrupted
Jack. “I particularly want to hear it,
Socker.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the janitor, delighted that he had
at last found an earnest listener.</p>

<p>“But not now,” said Jack. “We must get to
work. Do you like pie, Socker?”</p>

<p>“Do I, Mr.&#160;Ranger? Well, I guess I do. I
remember once when we were at Gettysburg——”</p>

<p>“Bony, where’s that extra choice pie you had?”
asked Jack with a wink at his chum. “Give it to
Mr.&#160;Socker here,” and Bony passed over the bit of
pastry that had met with the accident in the hall.</p>

<p>“That will keep him quiet for a while,” said
Jack in a whisper.</p>

<p>The lads, bearing the good things Jack had provided,
passed through the boiler-room and into a
storage apartment, where cans of oil, waste, tools
and the like were kept. Socker had arranged some
boards on a couple of sawhorses for the students,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_69" href="#Page_69"><span title="69">&#160;</span></a>
and there, by the light of several candles stuck in
the necks of bottles, the table was spread.</p>

<p>“Say, but this is jolly, all right,” said Sam
Chalmers. “Jack, you’re a public benefactor.”</p>

<p>He leaned over to shake hands with our hero.</p>

<p>“Look out! You’ll upset the table!” cried Jack,
as Sam, leaning against the boards, tilted them.</p>

<p>“Save the pieces!” cried Nat, springing to the
rescue.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, be seated!” invited Jack as the lads
arranged themselves about the table. Socker had
provided planks, stretched across big, empty oilcans.
“Here you are, Will, right next to me,”
went on our hero in a low tone to the lad who had
joined him in the dark hall. “I’ll introduce you
presently.”</p>

<p>No one of Jack’s chums had yet noticed the new
lad, for Will had kept in the shadows, and there
was much confusion attending the placing of the
good things on the board. But as the guests prepared
to seat themselves, Sam Chalmers caught
sight of the unfamiliar face of Will Williams.
He knew he was not one of Jack’s crowd, and
thinking the lad might have come uninvited he said:</p>

<p>“We have a stranger with us.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden hush, and all eyes were fastened
on Will, who turned red.</p>

<p>“He is a stranger,” said Jack quickly, “but we
are going to cure that. Boys of Washington Hall—the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_70" href="#Page_70"><span title="70">&#160;</span></a>
top-notchers—the élite—the high-rollers—the
cream of the bunch—allow me to present my
friend Bill Williams. He is one of us, though I
didn’t know it until to-day. I’m giving this blowout
in his honor. Henceforth he is one of us, and
in token of that we will dub him not William, but
Bill, which has a more kindly sound. Fellows,
salute our new member!”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_71" href="#Page_71"><span title="71">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>AN ALARM OF FIRE</small></h2>


<p>There was a moment’s pause after Jack’s announcement,
then, as one, the assembled lads bowed
to Will, or, as he was to be more affectionately
called, Bill. He blushed with pleasure at the new
sensation of having friends.</p>

<p>“New member of the Irrepressibles, we, who are
about to dine, salute thee!” exclaimed Sam.</p>

<p>“We sure do, and now, if the salutin’ ceremony is
over, let’s eat,” suggested Bob Movel.</p>

<p>“Wait until Fred gives us a tune,” came from
Nat. “Jumping gewhillikins, but they always have
music at a banquet!”</p>

<p>“Then don’t let Fred play—if you want music,”
said Sam, dodging behind Jack to be out of the
musical student’s reach.</p>

<p>“I’ll punch your head!” exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>“No, go on and play,” said Jack. “It will liven
things up a bit.”</p>

<p>So Fred got out his mouth-organ, and rendered
a lively march, the boys parading around the table,
each one clapping on the back the new member of
the informal club.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_72" href="#Page_72"><span title="72">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Now I guess we can eat,” announced Jack. “Bill,
pass that plate of sandwiches at your elbow. Fred,
juggle the doughnuts down this way. Sam, don’t
let those pies go to sleep. Bob, you open some of
the ginger-ale, but don’t let it pop too loud, or
Doc. Mead may think it’s the safety valve of the
boiler going off, and send Martin to investigate.”</p>

<p>The lads were soon actively engaged in putting
away the good things, and then, for a time, conversation
languished, save for intermittent remarks.</p>

<p>“Are you having a good time, boys?” asked
Socker, poking his head in the storeroom, after
having shoveled some coal on the fire.</p>

<p>“We sure are, and we’re much obliged to you,”
replied Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. It reminds me, to see you
all eating, of how I once was nearly starved in
Andersonville prison. I was in there——”</p>

<p>“I’m coming out to hear that story in about five
minutes, Socker,” interrupted Jack. “Have it all
ready for me.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised the janitor, as he went back
to look at the boiler.</p>

<p>It was a merry time, and Will, or, as the boys
called him, Bill, enjoyed it more than any one.
It seemed as if a new world had opened before
him. His face lost the downcast look, his eyes
were brighter, and he even ventured to make one
or two jokes. The boys seemed to like him, and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_73" href="#Page_73"><span title="73">&#160;</span></a>
Jack was glad of it, for he had a genuine admiration
for the new boy, and wanted to befriend
him.</p>

<p>To some of his chums he told something of
Will’s story, and there was general indignation
expressed against the mean guardian.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, I guess we’ve eaten everything
except the table and the candles,” said Jack after a
while. “I think we’d better be getting back to our
rooms, for Martin may take it into his head to
pay a late visit.”</p>

<p>The advice was timely, and as the lads had had
a jolly evening, they prepared to disperse. They
cleared away the remains of the feast, leaving
Socker to put aside the boards, cans and bottles.
As they filed out of the boiler-room, Socker called
to Jack:</p>

<p>“I’m all ready to tell you that story now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to see these infants to bed,” replied
our hero with a wink. “Then I’ll be back, Socker.
Think over all the points in the story. I don’t
want to lose any.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, Mr.&#160;Ranger,” and Socker sat down
in a chair before the fire and began to think deeply.</p>

<p>The students reached their rooms without being
detected, whispering to Jack, on their way, their
thanks for the spread.</p>

<p>“I’ve had the best time in my life!” exclaimed<a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" href="#Page_74"><span title="74">&#160;</span></a>
Will as he clasped Jack’s hand at his door. “I
can’t thank you enough.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t try,” replied Jack. “Brace up,
and you’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Whether it was the effect of the pie or doughnuts
Jack never knew, but some time during the
night he began to dream that he had swallowed a
big piece of pastry the wrong way, and it was
choking him. He sat up, gasping for breath, and
found to his horror that his room was full of
smoke.</p>

<p>“There’s a fire!” he spoke aloud. Then he
called to Nat, who was in the bed across from
him:</p>

<p>“Nat! Nat! Wake up! There’s a fire!”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t get up any higher,” sleepily responded
Nat, turning over in bed, and evidently
thinking that his chum had asked him to climb up
a tree.</p>

<p>“It’s a fire!” cried Jack, springing from bed.
“There’s a fire, Nat!”</p>

<p>This roused the sleeping lad, who also bounded
out from under the covers. There was no doubt
about it. Their room was filled with smoke, which
was getting thicker every minute.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!” yelled Jack, for he heard
no one stirring about in the school dormitory, and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_75" href="#Page_75"><span title="75">&#160;</span></a>
he rightly guessed that he was the first to sound
the alarm.</p>

<p>His call was sufficient to arouse students on
either side of him, and then Martin and several
of the teachers came running from their apartments.</p>

<p>“Where is the fire, Ranger?” asked Mr.&#160;Gales,
one of the mathematical instructors.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but my room is full of smoke.”</p>

<p>Just then, from somewhere below stairs, sounded
a cry:</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! There’s a fire in the boiler-room!
Help!”</p>

<p>“That’s Socker, the janitor,” declared Jack.
“Come on, fellows, we’ll help him.”</p>

<p>He rushed for the stairs, attired in his pajamas
and slippers, and was followed by Nat and a score
of other students.</p>

<p>“Boys, boys! Be careful!” called Mr.&#160;Gales.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the smoke was getting thicker, and
every one was beginning to cough.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire!” yelled Socker.</p>

<p>Jack, leading the rush of pupils through the
smoke, soon reached the boiler-room in the basement.
Through the clouds of vapor, illuminated
by gasjets here and there left burning all night in
case of accident, he could see the flicker of flames.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he called. “There are some pails<a class="pagenum" id="Page_76" href="#Page_76"><span title="76">&#160;</span></a>
with water along the wall, and a couple of hand
extinguishers!”</p>

<p>They reached the engine-room, to find a blaze in
one corner, where Socker kept some waste, cans of
oil, old rags and brooms. The fire had been eating
toward the storeroom, where the midnight feast
had been held.</p>

<p>“Forward the fire brigade!” yelled Jack as he
grabbed up an extinguisher and began to play it
on the flames, while some of his chums caught up
pails of water, kept filled for just such an emergency.</p>

<p>The flames were beginning to crackle now, and
the fire seemed likely to be a bad one.</p>

<p>Suddenly Socker, who was running about doing
nothing, looked at the boiler and cried out:</p>

<p>“Run! Everybody run! The safety valve has
caught, and the boiler will blow up! Run! Run!”</p>

<p>The boys needed no second warning. Jack
paused for a moment, for the stream from his
extinguisher was beginning to quench the flames,
but as he saw Socker fleeing from the room, and
as he reflected that it would be dangerous to remain,
he turned and fled, carrying the apparatus
with him.</p>

<p>“Everybody out!” cried Socker. “Get ’em all
out! The boiler will blow up!”</p>

<p>The lads, lightly clad, fled through the basement
door out into the night. The snow, which had<a class="pagenum" id="Page_77" href="#Page_77"><span title="77">&#160;</span></a>
ceased that evening, had started in again, and the
storm was howling as if in glee at the plight of
the students of Washington Hall, who were driven
from their beds by fire.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_78" href="#Page_78"><span title="78">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>SAVING THE FLAGS</small></h2>


<p>“Telephone for the town fire department!”
cried Dr.&#160;Mead, who had been apprised of the
fire. He, like all the others, was out in the storm,
with a few clothes he had hastily donned.</p>

<p>“They can’t get in the boiler-room to fight the
fire!” cried Socker.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because the boiler will blow up. Something is
wrong with the safety valve, and there are two
hundred pounds of steam on. The boiler is only
meant for one hundred.”</p>

<p>“How did the fire start? What made the safety
valve get out of order?” asked the principal.</p>

<p>The group of students and teachers, standing in
the storm, could now see the bright flicker of
flames in the boiler-room. “I don’t know,” replied
Socker. “I was asleep in front of the boiler,
waiting to put some more coal on, when all of a
sudden I smelled smoke.”</p>

<p>“How long before the boiler will go up?” asked
Dr.&#160;Mead anxiously. “I have some valuable books
I must save.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_79" href="#Page_79"><span title="79">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>He started to re-enter the school.</p>

<p>“Don’t go back!” cried Socker. “It’s liable to
go up any minute!”</p>

<p>Dr.&#160;Mead returned to the waiting group, his
face betraying intense excitement.</p>

<p>“We must get the fire out!” he cried. “Can’t
some one send word to the village?”</p>

<p>“There’s a telephone in Mr.&#160;Raspen’s house,
about half a mile away,” volunteered Sam. “I’ll
run there.”</p>

<p>He started off, and just as he did so a series of
alarming cries broke out at one of the upper corridor
windows of the school.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire!” cried a voice. “Der school ist
being gonsumed by der fierce elements! Safe me,
somebodies! I must get out my German flag!
I must out get quvick, alretty yet!”</p>

<p>The anxious face of Professor Garlach appeared
at one of the windows.</p>

<p>“Don’t jump!” cried Jack, as the teacher seemed
about to do so. “You’ve got time enough to come
down the stairs.”</p>

<p>“B-r-r-r-r! It’s cold!” cried Nat Anderson, as
some snow got inside the slippers he had put on,
and some flakes sifted down his back.</p>

<p>“It will soon be warm enough,” observed Jack.
“The fire is gaining. Poor Washington Hall! It
deserved a better fate than being burned down.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_80" href="#Page_80"><span title="80">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Look!” cried Sam, who had paused in his run
to go to the telephone. “There’s Socrat.”</p>

<p>The French professor had joined his German
colleague at the window, and both were struggling
to climb out of it.</p>

<p>“Stand aside, German brute zat you aire!” exclaimed
the Frenchman. “I must save ze glorious
flag of <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la belle France</span>! Let me toss it out of ze
window!”</p>

<p>“I vill nottings of der kind do alretty yet!” responded
Professor Garlach. “I vos here firstest!”</p>

<p>“Zen you are no gentlemans!” was Professor
Socrat’s reply. “Bah! <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sacre!</span> Let me out, I
demand of you! I am insult zat you should flout
zat rag in my eyes!”</p>

<p>The wind had blown the German flag, which
Professor Garlach held, into the face of the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“Rag! <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hein!</span> You call dot glorious flag a rag!
<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Himmel!</span> I vill of der mincemeat you make now!”</p>

<p>Professor Garlach made a grab for his enemy.
To do so he lost his hold on his precious flag. It
fluttered out of the window and to the ground.</p>

<p>“Save it! Save it!” he cried, leaning out. “My
flag!”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it,” shouted Jack.</p>

<p>With a quick movement the German snatched
the French colors from the hand of Professor<a class="pagenum" id="Page_81" href="#Page_81"><span title="81">&#160;</span></a>
Socrat. An instant later that, too, was fluttering
to the snow.</p>

<p>“Oh! <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la belle</span> tri-color! It is insult! I moost
have blood to satisfy my honaire!” shouted the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>He made a lunge, and clasped Professor Garlach
about the neck. The two struggled at the
window. With a quick wit Jack grabbed the two
flags, and, waving them, intertwined, above his
head, he shouted:</p>

<p>“See, professors! A German-French alliance at
last. Both flags are saved. They have not touched
the ground. Now come on down and get them.
Quick! The fire is gaining!”</p>

<p>“<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach!</span> Dot is goot! Der flag is not sullied!”
called Professor Garlach.</p>

<p>“And mine also—my beautiful tri-color, eet is
safe!” added Professor Socrat. “Ranger, you are
ze one grand gentleman. I salute you!” and the
enthusiastic Frenchman blew Jack a kiss.</p>

<p>The two enemies, reconciled by the flag incident,
embraced each other, and as Jack called to them
to make haste down the stairway, they disappeared
from the window.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the smoke was pouring from the
boiler-room, and the flames were brighter. Sam
had raced off through the storm to the telephone
to summon the fire department.</p>

<p>“Say, I don’t believe that boiler’s going to blow<a class="pagenum" id="Page_82" href="#Page_82"><span title="82">&#160;</span></a>
up,” announced Jack. “If it was going to, it
would have done so long ago. I’m going to take
a look.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” begged Socker. “You’ll all risk your
life!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be rash, Ranger,” cautioned Dr.&#160;Mead.</p>

<p>“I think Socker exaggerated the danger,” replied
our hero. “I’m going to take a look.”</p>

<p>He ran back to the engine-room and looked in.
He could see the boiler plainly, as the place was
brightly illuminated by the flames. His eyes sought
the steam gage.</p>

<p>“Why!” he cried. “There are only twenty
pounds of steam on! Socker took it for two hundred.
There’s no danger. That’s a low pressure.”</p>

<p>Then he raised his voice in a shout:</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows! Help put out the fire!
There’s no danger! The boiler’s all right!”</p>

<p>There was an immediate rush. Jack still held
his extinguisher, and Nat Anderson had secured
one. Several other students, hearing Jack’s reassuring
news, rushed into the school, and came back
with pieces of hand apparatus.</p>

<p>“Now to douse the fire!” yelled Jack, again turning
on the chemical stream.</p>

<p>“Use snow!” cried Bob Movel. “That will
help!”</p>

<p>He scooped up some in a water pail that he had<a class="pagenum" id="Page_83" href="#Page_83"><span title="83">&#160;</span></a>
emptied, and tossed the mass of white crystals on
the edge of the flames, which were in one corner
of the boiler-room. There was a hissing sound, a
cloud of steam arose, and the fire at that particular
point died out.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Jack, and other students
and some of the teachers followed Bob’s example.
The fire was fast being gotten under control, and
Socker, returning to the boiler-room, had attached
a small hose to a faucet, and was playing water on
the flames.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the noise made by the shouting
lads, the hiss of snow and water, and the snapping
of the flames, there sounded a cry of distress.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Help!”</p>

<p>“Some one is caught by the flames! They must
have eaten their way up to the upper floors!” cried
Dr.&#160;Mead.</p>

<p>“It iss dot boy Snaith—he und two odders!”
announced Professor Garlach, rushing into the
boiler-room, his beloved German flag clasped in
his arms, where Jack had placed it.</p>

<p>“Quick! <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sacre!</span> We must not let zem perish!”
added Professor Socrat, as he caught up a big fire
shovel and dashed from the basement. “I will
rescue zem!”</p>

<p>“Und me also,” added Professor Garlach as he
grabbed up a long poker.</p>

<p>“There can’t be much danger,” said Jack. “The<a class="pagenum" id="Page_84" href="#Page_84"><span title="84">&#160;</span></a>
fire is almost out. Here, Nat, you keep things
moving here, and I’ll take a look.”</p>

<p>He ran out into the storm. Looking up at the
side of the school, he saw, framed in a window,
behind which a light burned, the figures of Dock
Snaith, Pud Armstrong and Glen Forker.</p>

<p>“Save us! Save us!” cried Dock. “We can’t
get out.”</p>

<p>“Catch me! I’m going to jump!” yelled Pud.</p>

<p>“No! no! Don’t!” Jack called. “There’s no
danger. I’ll come and get you!” and he dashed
into the main entrance of the school.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_85" href="#Page_85"><span title="85">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE GUN CLUB</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments after Jack’s disappearance
into the burning school, the spectators, pupils and
teachers hardly knew what to do or say. The
thick volumes of smoke that rolled out, even
though they knew the fire in the boiler-room was
under control, seemed to indicate that the conflagration
was raging in some other part of the building.</p>

<p>“<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach!</span> Dot brafe Ranger fellow!” exclaimed
Professor Garlach. “He vill burned be alretty
yet! <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach Himmel!</span> Der school will down burn!”</p>

<p>“So! <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sacre!</span>” exclaimed the French professor.
“It iss too true, zat which you speak. Terrible!
terrible!”</p>

<p>“Und dose odder boys! Der flames vill gonsume
dem also!” wailed the German.</p>

<p>“But ze flags—ze flags of our countries—zey
are safe!” exclaimed Professor Socrat, and at this
thought the two former enemies threw their arms
about each other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jack was dashing upstairs.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_86" href="#Page_86"><span title="86">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I don’t see any signs of fire,” he said. “I believe
it’s only smoke, after all.”</p>

<p>Up he went to the floor where Dock Snaith and
his cronies had their rooms. The smoke was very
thick, but there were no evidences of flame. And
as Jack reached the trio, who were still leaning out
of the window and calling for help, he saw that a
lighted gasjet, reflecting through the clouds of
vapor, had made it appear as if there were flames.</p>

<p>“Oh! will no one save us!” cried Snaith. “Fellows,
I guess we’re going to die!” and he began to
whimper.</p>

<p>“No! no!” yelled Pud Armstrong. “Let’s
jump!”</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m afraid!” blubbered Snaith.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jack, bursting into the room.
“There’s no danger. It’s only smoke. The fire’s
’most out.”</p>

<p>“Are you—are you sure?” faltered Glen Forker.</p>

<p>“Yes. Come on! It’s all down in the boiler-room.”</p>

<p>Thus assured, the three bullies, who were the
worst kind of cowards, followed Jack through the
smoke-filled corridors. When the four appeared
there was a cheer, and Professors Socrat and Garlach
embraced each other again.</p>

<p>“It’s all out!” cried Nat Anderson, running from
the boiler-room. “Fire’s all out!”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_87" href="#Page_87"><span title="87">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>He was smoke-begrimed, and his thin clothing
was wet through.</p>

<p>“Are you sure there is no more danger?” asked
Dr.&#160;Mead.</p>

<p>“None at all,” answered Nat.</p>

<p>Jack hurried up to join his chum. The snow was
changing into rain, mingled with sleet, and it was
freezing as it fell.</p>

<p>“Say, if I was you I’d go in,” exclaimed a voice
at Jack’s elbow, and he turned to see a lad standing
near him, whose lower jaw was slowly moving
up and down, for he was chewing gum.</p>

<p>“Hello, Budge,” said Jack. “Where have you
been all this while?” For Budge Rankin, the odd
character whom Jack had befriended by getting
him the position of assistant janitor at Washington
Hall, was clad in overcoat and cap.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I’ve been in town,” answered Budge,
stretching some gum out of his mouth and beginning
to pull it in again by the simple process of
winding it around his tongue.</p>

<p>“In town?” questioned Nat.</p>

<p>“Yep. ’Smynightoff.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was your night off,” repeated Jack, for
Budge had a habit of running his words together.</p>

<p>“Yep. Wow! My gum’s frozen!” he exclaimed,
pausing in the act of trying to chew it
again. “But say,” he added, “if the fire’s out,
you’d better go inside. It’s cold here.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_88" href="#Page_88"><span title="88">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“You’re right; it is,” admitted Jack, shivering.</p>

<p>“Here, take my coat,” spoke Budge, starting to
take it off.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I’ll do nothing of the sort,” replied
Jack. “I’ll go in and get warm.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s what we’d all better do,” added
Nat, for the wintry wind was beginning to make
itself felt, now that the exercise in putting out the
fire no longer warmed them.</p>

<p>“Come, young gentlemen, get inside,” called Dr.&#160;Mead,
and the students filed back into the school.
The smoke was rapidly clearing away, and after a
tour of the building, to make sure the flames were
not lurking in any unsuspected corners, the pupils
were ordered to bed.</p>

<p>Jack and his chums managed to get a little sleep
before morning, but when our hero awoke, after
troubled dreams, he called out:</p>

<p>“Say, Nat, there doesn’t seem to be any steam
heat in this room.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t,” announced Nat, after feeling of
the radiator. “It’s as cold as a stone.”</p>

<p>“Socker must have let the fire in the boiler get
low,” went on Jack. “Probably he thought the
blaze last night was enough. B-r-r-r! Let’s get
dressed in a hurry and go down where it’s warm.”</p>

<p>They soon descended to the main dining-room,
where to their surprise they found a number of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_89" href="#Page_89"><span title="89">&#160;</span></a>
shivering students and teachers. There was no
warmth in the radiators there, either.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach,</span> Ranger,” explained Professor Garlach,
“der fire from der boiler has avay gone, alretty,
und dere is no more hot vasser mit vich more can
be made yet. So ve haf der coldness.”</p>

<p>“I should say we did,” commented Jack. “Can’t
Socker start a new fire and get up steam?”</p>

<p>“I believe not,” said a voice at Jack’s side, and
he turned to see his new friend, Will Williams.
“I heard the janitor tell Dr.&#160;Mead something was
wrong with the boiler. They have gone to look at
it.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get my overcoat,” spoke Nat, and
his example was followed by several others, for
the room was very chilly. Presently Dr.&#160;Mead
came in, followed by Socker.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen of Washington Hall,” began
the head of the school, “I regret to inform you
that the fire last night has damaged the boiler in
such a way that it is impossible to get up steam.
I have just made an investigation, and the boiler
will have to have extensive repairs. It will take
some time to make them, and, I regret to say it,
but I will have to close the school until after the
holidays——”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” yelled Nat.</p>

<p>The doctor looked shocked. Then he smiled.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_90" href="#Page_90"><span title="90">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Such feeling is perhaps natural,” he said, “and
I would resent it, only I know that Nat Anderson
is a good pupil, who loves his school, as, I hope,
you all do. But we cannot hold sessions in cold
rooms. Now I suggest that you all retire to the
general assembly room. There is a large fireplace
there, and I will have the janitor build a blaze in
it. You can at least have a warm breakfast, and
discuss future plans.”</p>

<p>There was a buzz of excitement at once, and the
lads made a rush for the assembly room. There, a
little later, somewhat warmed by a big log fire,
they ate breakfast. The fire of the night previous,
it was learned, had been caused by spontaneous
combustion among some oiled rags, and the damage
was only in the boiler-room. There had been
no need for the fire department from the village,
and though Sam had summoned it, the order had
been countermanded before the apparatus started,
so there was no damage by water to the school.
Some smoke-begrimed walls were the only evidence
in the upper stories of the fire.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Nat Anderson, as Jack and
several of his chums gathered around in a warm
corner, “no more school for a couple of months,
anyhow. Solidified snowballs! but I wonder what
we’ll do all that time?”</p>

<p>“Go home and rest up,” suggested Bony Balmore<a class="pagenum" id="Page_91" href="#Page_91"><span title="91">&#160;</span></a>
as he cracked a couple of finger knuckles just
to keep in practice.</p>

<p>“Rest! Why, we just had one during the summer
vacation, Bony,” remarked Fred Kaler.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can use more,” said Bony. “What are
you going to do, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I’m going hunting and camping,” announced
Jack quietly.</p>

<p>“Hunting?” questioned Nat.</p>

<p>“Camping?” cried Sam Chalmers.</p>

<p>“Sure,” went on Jack. “I’ve been thinking of
it for some time, but I didn’t see any opportunity
of doing it. I’m going camping and hunting after
big game out West, and I wish some of you
fellows would go along.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any guns—that is, such as would
do for big game,” objected Nat.</p>

<p>“We can get ’em,” declared Jack. “I was thinking
we fellows who went camping before might
organize a sort of gun club and take a trip. Now
that the school is to close, it will give us just
the chance we want.”</p>

<p>“A gun club,” mused Nat. “Say, but that’s a
fine idea! Petrified pedestrians! but we’ll call it
Jack Ranger’s Gun Club! That will be a dandy
name.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” said Jack quickly.
“It won’t be my gun club any more than it
will be yours or Bony’s or Sam’s.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_92" href="#Page_92"><span title="92">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“But you’re organizing it.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference. Every fellow
will pay his own way. We’ll just call it a gun
club.”</p>

<p>But, in spite of Jack’s objection, when the organization
was perfected a little later, every one
thought of it as Jack Ranger’s club, even if they
didn’t say so.</p>

<p>“Where could we go hunting?” asked Nat.
“There’s no big game around here.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” admitted Jack, “but I
know where there is some, and I’m going.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Out in the Shoshone Mountains, in the ‘bad
lands’ district of Wyoming. There’s the finest
hunting in the United States.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the gun club!” cried Nat. “I’m
going, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t leave me behind,” pleaded Sam.
“I guess you can count me in.”</p>

<p>Jack looked around at the eager faces of his
chums. Then off in a corner he saw the somewhat
downcast countenance of the new boy—Will
Williams.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he wouldn’t like to go, too?” Jack
said to himself.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_93" href="#Page_93"><span title="93">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>WILL RUNS AWAY</small></h2>


<p>The boys gathered about the warm fire, crowding
close around Jack to hear more details of the
proposed trip of the gun club.</p>

<p>“I’ve been reading up about hunting big game,”
went on Jack, “and I asked my father if I could
go the first chance I got. He said I could, and
now I’ve got the chance.”</p>

<p>“What are those bad lands?” asked Fred Kaler.
“Any Indians out there?”</p>

<p>“Some, I guess. A few Sioux, Crows and some
Shoshones. But they’re mostly guides. You see,
bad lands are what the Westerners call a region
that isn’t very good for anything but hunting.
They consist of a lot of sandstone peaks, with
deserts here and there.”</p>

<p>“And what can you hunt there?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Oh, lots of things. Big-horn sheep, bears, elk,
deer, jack-rabbits and birds. It will be lots of
sport.”</p>

<p>“Wyoming, eh?” mused Sam. “That’s quite a
way off.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_94" href="#Page_94"><span title="94">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Yes, it is, but we’ve got lots of time. I’ve
been making some inquiries, and they say the best
spot to aim for is around the town of Cody, which
is named after Buffalo Bill. You see, we can go to
Fort Custer, and from there we have to travel in
wagons or on horses. I’ve got a route all mapped
out. We’ll go along a small stream, called Sage
Creek, across the Forty-mile Desert, and hunt along
the Shoshone River, near Heart Mountain. It’s
a fine hunting ground, and we’ll have no end of
fun camping out.”</p>

<p>“But it’ll be cold,” objected Bony. “There’ll
be snow.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” asked Jack. “It’ll do you good.
We’ll have warm tents, warm clothing, and we
can build big camp fires that will make the ones
here look like a baby bonfire.”</p>

<p>“Galloping gasmeters!” exclaimed Nat. “When
can we start, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll take some time to get ready. We’ve
got to get the guns and camping outfit together.”</p>

<p>The boys talked for some considerable time
about the prospective trip. Socker, meanwhile,
came in to replenish the fire. In some of the rooms
there were stoves and gas heaters, and these were
soon in operation to take the chill off the apartments,
for the big building, being without steam
heat, was like a barn. Budge Rankin came in once
with some logs for the fire.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_95" href="#Page_95"><span title="95">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Goinome?” he said to Jack.</p>

<p>“Going home?” repeated our hero. “That’s
what I am, Budge. Are you?”</p>

<p>“SoonsIkin.”</p>

<p>“As soon as you can, eh? Well, it will be this
afternoon for mine,” went on Jack. “Can’t stay
here and freeze.”</p>

<p>Dr.&#160;Mead and his assistants were busy arranging
for the departure of the pupils, while the head
of the school also telegraphed for new parts of the
damaged boiler.</p>

<p>Jack and Nat packed their belongings, and prepared
to start for Denton.</p>

<p>“Say, who all are going camping and hunting?”
asked Nat, pausing in the act of thrusting his
clothes into his trunk.</p>

<p>“Why, I was thinking if we could take the same
crowd we had before you and I were captured and
taken aboard the <i>Polly Ann</i> this summer, it would
be nice,” replied Jack. “There’s you and Bony
and Sam and me.”</p>

<p>“And Budge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Budge. I’ll take him along if he’ll
go. He likes to putter around camp, but he doesn’t
care much about hunting. He’d rather chew gum.”</p>

<p>Though Budge worked as assistant janitor at
Washington Hall, Jack and his chums did not
consider that his position was at all degrading.
Jack felt that Budge was one of his best friends,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_96" href="#Page_96"><span title="96">&#160;</span></a>
and though the lad was poor he was independent,
which quality Jack liked in him.</p>

<p>“And I tell you some one else I’m going to take,
if I can manage it,” went on our hero.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Bill Williams. I like that fellow, and he’s
had it pretty hard. I’d like to do something for
him, and I’m going to ask him to come hunting with
us.”</p>

<p>“S’pose he’ll go?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Guess I’ll go ask him now.
Say, you finish crowding my stuff into my trunk,
will you? We want to catch the twelve o’clock
train for Denton.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Nat, ending his packing by the
simple process of crowding all that remained of
his clothes into the trunk and then jumping on
them with both feet, so that they would collapse
sufficiently to allow the lid to fasten.</p>

<p>Jack found the new boy sitting in his room beside
his trunk and valise.</p>

<p>“All ready to go home?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer in a sad sort of voice.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t seem to be very glad that school
has closed, giving you an additional vacation,”
remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ve got to go and live with my guardian.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_97" href="#Page_97"><span title="97">&#160;</span></a>
He hates me. He’ll be twitting me of how
I robbed him, when I had no more to do with
the loss of his money than—than you did. I
was beginning to like it here, but now I’ve got
to go back. It’s tough!”</p>

<p>“Say, how would you like to come with me?”</p>

<p>“Come with you? Where?”</p>

<p>“Hunting in the Shoshone Mountains.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” asked Will eagerly, his
eyes brightening. He sprang to his feet, all his
sadness gone.</p>

<p>“Of course I mean it,” went on Jack. “Some
of my chums are going to form a sort of gun club,
and I’d like to include you in it. Will you come?”</p>

<p>“Will I come? Say, I——”</p>

<p>Then the lad paused. The light faded from his
eyes. He sank back into his chair.</p>

<p>“No—no,” he said slowly. “I’m much obliged,
but I—I guess I can’t go.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>Will hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well—er—you see—er—the fact is, I haven’t
any money. My guardian pays all the bills, and,
as I told you, he doesn’t give me any spending
money. Not even enough for a postage stamp.”</p>

<p>“That’s tough,” said Jack, “but I guess you
didn’t quite understand me. I didn’t ask you to
spend any money.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_98" href="#Page_98"><span title="98">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“How can I go camping and hunting, away off
in Wyoming, without money<ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: question mark added">?</ins>”</p>

<p>“You’ll go as my guest,” said Jack simply. “I’m
inviting you to go with me. The other fellows are
coming on their own hook, as members of the
gun club, but I’d like to have you come just as my
guest. Will you do that?”</p>

<p>“Will I?” Once more the lad’s eyes sparkled.
“Of course I will,” he said, “only it doesn’t seem
right to have you pay my way. If my uncle only
knew of my plight he’d give me some money, I’m
sure, but I can’t even write to him. It’s quite
mysterious the way he hides himself. I can’t understand
it.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll come?”</p>

<p>“Yes—but I don’t like to feel that it is costing
you money.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you,” said Jack quickly.
“I’m pretty well off, and my dad has all the money
he can use. I guess you didn’t hear about the gold
mine Nat and I helped discover when we were
out West looking for my father.”</p>

<p>“No, I never did.”</p>

<p>“Well, that will keep the wolf from howling
around the door for a while. I’m real glad you’re
coming, Bill. I hope you’ll enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“I know I will. I’m fond of hunting and camping.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_99" href="#Page_99"><span title="99">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“All right. Now I’m going back to Denton. I
s’pose you’re going home, too?”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t much of a home. I live in Hickville
with my guardian.”</p>

<p>“Hickville, eh? That’s about a hundred miles
from Denton. Well, I was going to say that I’ll
write you a few days before we start, and you can
come on to Denton.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go and finish packing. I left Nat
Anderson to do it, and he’s just as likely to put
things upside down as right side up. I’ll see you
at Denton, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Will. But Jack did not see the
new boy at Denton, and not until some time after
their parting at the school; and when he did see
him, it was under strange circumstances.</p>

<p>Good-bys were said among the pupils and teachers
of Washington Hall, and Jack and his chums
separated, he and Nat journeying to Denton, which
they reached that night, much to the surprise of
Mr.&#160;Ranger, Jack’s three aunts, and Nat’s folks.</p>

<p>Jack lost no time in beginning his preparations
for the camping trip, his father consenting that
the gun club might be formed. Our hero wrote
many letters, arranged for transportation to the
West, got into communication with a guide near
Cody, Wyoming, and invited Budge to go along.</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll go,” said the gum-chewing lad as he<a class="pagenum" id="Page_100" href="#Page_100"><span title="100">&#160;</span></a>
placed into his mouth a fresh wad of the sticky
substance. “When’ll it be?”</p>

<p>“In about two weeks,” said Jack. “There are
quite a few things to do yet.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Nat Anderson, Sam Chalmers
and Bony Balmore had secured permission from
their parents to go with Jack, and they were busy
at their respective homes, making up their kits.
Sam and Bony lived about a day’s journey from
Denton.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll write to Bill, and invite him to come
on,” said Jack one night, and then he waited for
a reply from the lad with whom he had so recently
become friends.</p>

<p>“Here’s Bill’s answer,” said Jack to Nat one
afternoon a few days later, when they went down
to the post-office, and Jack received a letter marked
“Hickville.”</p>

<p>As Jack read it he uttered a low whistle.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Can’t he come?” asked
Nat.</p>

<p>“No. This is from his rascally guardian. It’s
to me. Bill’s run away.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_101" href="#Page_101"><span title="101">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>OFF ON THE TRIP</small></h2>


<p>Nat stood still in the street and stared at Jack.</p>

<p>“What’s that you said?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Bill’s run away. Listen and I’ll read the letter
to you. It says: ‘A few days ago my ward,
William Williams, returned from Washington
Hall, greatly to my regret. He explained the cause
of his enforced vacation, and stated that you had
asked him to go off on a hunting trip. Of course,
I refused to let him go. In the first place I don’t
believe in hunting, and for a lad of William’s age to
go off to the West, where he may learn bad habits,
is not the thing. Besides, I cannot trust him away
from the authority of older persons.’”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that jolt you?” commented Jack as
he looked up from the letter.</p>

<p>Nat nodded.</p>

<p>“Suffering snufflebugs!” he exclaimed. “That’s
the limit—isn’t it, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near. Listen; there’s more to it: ‘When
I told my ward that he could not go, he answered
me very sharply that if his uncle was here he could
get permission. That may be, but his uncle is not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_102" href="#Page_102"><span title="102">&#160;</span></a>
here. He begged to be allowed to go, but I was
firm in my refusal. I do not believe in such nonsense
as camping out, and I told William so.</p>

<p>“‘The other day, to my surprise, he disappeared
from my home, and I have not been able to get a
trace of him. I am forced to come to the conclusion
that he has run away in a fit of anger, because
I would not let him go camping with you.
I hold you partly to blame for this, as it was wrong
of you to ask him to go. I must therefore ask you,
in case you see him, to at once compel him to
return to me. I absolutely forbid him to go camping
with you, and should he join you, you must
send him back. He has defied me, and must be
punished. If you see him, turn him over to the
nearest police officer, inform me, and I will come
and get him.’”</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t that loosen your liver pin!”
exclaimed Nat. “Do you s’pose he’s coming here,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’m glad he ran away from such
a mean man as Mr.&#160;Gabel, though. The idea of
not letting him go camping! It’s a shame!”</p>

<p>“Will you make him go back if he does come?”</p>

<p>“Will I? Not much! I’ll take him camping.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Nat. “Gollywoggled
gimlet giblets! but some persons can be mean when
they try real hard! I wonder if he will come
here?”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_103" href="#Page_103"><span title="103">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“It’s hard to say,” replied Jack. “He showed
spunk, though, in running away, and I guess he
couldn’t have taken any money with him, either,
for his guardian never let him have any. Well,
if he comes I’ll look out for him, and I’ll not hand
him over to a policeman, either.”</p>

<p>“Say,” called a voice from the other side of
the street. “Bettergome, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Better go home—what for, Budge?” asked
Jack as he saw the queer, gum-loving lad coming
toward him.</p>

<p>“Some of your camping stuff arrived, and your
aunts don’t know where to put it. It’s all over the
parlor floor,” explained Budge, taking his gum out
of his mouth in order to speak more plainly.</p>

<p>“I hope it’s my new gun!” exclaimed Jack.
“Come on, Nat, let’s hurry. Did they send you
after me, Budge?” for the assistant janitor used to
do chores for Jack’s aunts, and was constantly
around the house.</p>

<p>“’Swat,” replied Budge, that being his gum version
of “That’s what.”</p>

<p>Jack and Nat hurried to the former’s house.
They found several packages strewn about the
parlor, while Jack’s three maiden aunts were sitting
in chairs, staring helplessly at the accumulation
of stuff.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack!” exclaimed Aunt Angelina. “Whatever
is in all those packages? The man who<a class="pagenum" id="Page_104" href="#Page_104"><span title="104">&#160;</span></a>
brought them told us to be careful, as one was
marked firearms.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Jack easily. “It’s only
some guns and cartridges I expect, Aunt Angelina.”</p>

<p>“But—but suppose it should blow up the place,
Jack dear?” asked Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, and break my best set of china,” added
Aunt Josephine. “Oh, Jack, take them away,
please!”</p>

<p>“All right,” exclaimed Jack. “I’ll give you a
correct imitation of Marinello Booghoobally, <i>alias</i>
Hemp Smith, making things disappear. Catch
hold, Nat, and we’ll take them out to our private
office,” and with his chum’s aid Jack had soon removed
the offending packages to a loft over the
barn, which he had fitted up as a sort of clubroom.</p>

<p>“Now, Jack, be careful,” cautioned Mr.&#160;Ranger
as he saw his son busily engaged. “You know the
danger of firearms.”</p>

<p>“Sure, dad. Say, I wish you were going hunting
with us. Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I had enough of the West,” remarked Mr.&#160;Ranger,
as he thought of his enforced stay there
for many years. “I’m not going back. You
brought me home, Jack, and I’m going to stay
East. But I hope you have a good time.”</p>

<p>“I guess we will, if Jack has anything to do<a class="pagenum" id="Page_105" href="#Page_105"><span title="105">&#160;</span></a>
with it,” remarked Nat. “Say, Jack, that’s a dandy
gun.”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair,” observed our hero, as he brought
to view a fine new rifle, which he had sent for.</p>

<p>There was also a shotgun in the outfit, and many
other things to be used on the trail and in camp.
Nat’s eyes showed his admiration.</p>

<p>“Jumping jillflowers!” he exclaimed, “but you
are certainly doing this up good and brown, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I don’t like anything half done. It’s bad
for the digestion. You’ve got a gun, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a pretty fair one. But I wish I had
one like yours.”</p>

<p>“You can use it whenever you want to,” was
Jack’s generous offer. “Budge hasn’t any, and I’m
going to let him take my old rifle, though I expect
he’ll get the lock all stuck up with gum, so it won’t
shoot.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad Budge is going. He’ll keep things
lively.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m sorry Bill Williams can’t go. I
s’pose I’ve got to write to his guardian, and tell
him I haven’t seen Bill. Well, we’re almost ready.
I guess we can start in about three days.”</p>

<p>“When will Sam and Bony arrive?”</p>

<p>“I expect them to-morrow. Then we’ll make
for the West, for the mountains, the bad lands, the
desert, and the home of big game! Whoop! La-la!
Hold me down, Nat! I’m feeling fine!”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_106" href="#Page_106"><span title="106">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Jack began dancing about the loft, and the
loose boards of the floor made such a racket as
he leaped about, pulling Nat this way and that
in his enthusiasm, that Budge, who was cleaning
out the stable, called up from below:</p>

<p>“’Sanythingwrong?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing’s wrong, you old gum-masticating
specimen of a big-horn sheep,” replied Nat.
“We’re just working off some steam, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Better send it back to Washington Hall,”
advised Budge. “They need it there.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” laughed Jack.</p>

<p>Sam Chalmers and Bony Balmore arrived the
next day, and were entertained at Jack’s house.
Preparations were rushed, Nat and Budge finishing
their packing, and two days later, with their guns,
their camping outfits, and their baggage, they stood
in the railroad station, ready to start for the West.</p>

<p>It was a fine, clear, crisp November day, all
traces of the recent storm having disappeared, and
it seemed as if winter, having sent on an advance
agent, rather repented of opening the season so
early.</p>

<p>“It will be fine hunting weather,” said Jack as
he and his chums waited for the train.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” agreed Nat.</p>

<p>At that moment the agent came hurrying from
the depot, holding aloft an envelope.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_107" href="#Page_107"><span title="107">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Here’s a telegram for you, Jack Ranger,” he
said as he handed it over. “It just came.”</p>

<p>“A telegram?” mused Jack. “I wonder who it’s
from?”</p>

<p>He tore open the envelope, and as he read the
message he gave a start.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_108" href="#Page_108"><span title="108">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE BROKEN TRAIN</small></h2>


<p>“What is it?” asked Nat. “Any bad news?
Can’t you go camping?”</p>

<p>“It’s a message from Mr.&#160;Gabel, Bill Williams’
guardian,” replied Jack. “He says he has a clue
that Bill has gone out to a settlement on the Big
Horn River, in Montana, and he wants me to tell
him to go back to Hickville at once if I see him.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not likely to, are you? Is the Big
Horn River near where we are going?” asked
Bony.</p>

<p>“Not very, I guess,” answered Jack. “The Big
Horn starts in Wyoming, but I rather think the
chances are a thousand to one against seeing Bill.
Poor chap! He has a hard row to hoe. I wish
I could help him, but if he’s run away I don’t see
how I can.”</p>

<p>“I wish we’d meet him out West,” said Sam.
“Wouldn’t it be a joke if, after all, he could go
camping with us and fool his mean old guardian?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use discussing fairy tales?”
asked Jack. “Are you fellows all ready? Don’t
leave anything behind, now.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_109" href="#Page_109"><span title="109">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I guess we’re all here—what there is of us,”
remarked Bony, cracking his finger joints.</p>

<p>Just then the whistle of an approaching train
was heard.</p>

<p>“Gotchertickets?” asked Budge Rankin, taking
in a fresh wad of gum.</p>

<p>“Hu! Do you think I left them until now?”
inquired Jack. “I’ve got all the tickets. That’s
our train, fellows. Now we’ll say good-by to
Denton for a while, and live in the wild and woolly
West. Here, Budge, you take that satchel, and
I’ll tote the dress-suit case. Try and get seats
together, boys.”</p>

<p>A little later they were on the train and being
whirled rapidly away from Denton. They had
a long journey before them, and as the first part
of it contained no features of interest the lads
spent all their time discussing what was before
them.</p>

<p>“I want to get a big buck mule deer,” remarked
Jack as they were talking about what kind of game
they would be likely to find.</p>

<p>“Me for a big-horn sheep,” said Nat. “I want
to get the head mounted and put it in my room.
Then I’ll put my rifle across the horns, and show
it to every one who comes in.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’ll tell ’em you shot it, won’t you?”
asked Bony.</p>

<p>“Of course. I will shoot it.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_110" href="#Page_110"><span title="110">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“You won’t if you haven’t improved your aim
any since we were camping this summer.”</p>

<p>“I can shoot better than you can,” retorted
Nat.</p>

<p>“Like pie!” exclaimed Bony, discharging a whole
volley of knuckle-bone shots.</p>

<p>“Why, you missed that big muskrat you aimed
at, the day before Jack and I were kidnapped!”
taunted Nat.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you joggled my arm.”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“You did so.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” interposed Jack in a quiet voice.
“All the passengers are laughing at you two.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” replied Nat. “I guess I can
shoot as good as he can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I fancy there’ll be game enough out there,
so if you miss one thing you can hit another,”
consoled Sam. “What I want to see are the bad
lands. Just think of thousands of small sandstone
peaks, so much alike that they look like a stone
forest, with sulphur springs here and there, and
all sorts of queer-shaped rocks. It must be a great
sight!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s easy to get lost among those same
peaks,” added Jack. “I read of a hunter who went
out there, and he was so near camp that his friends
could hear him shouting, but they couldn’t locate
him until he began to fire his gun, and then they<a class="pagenum" id="Page_111" href="#Page_111"><span title="111">&#160;</span></a>
had hard work because of the echoes. We’ll have
to keep together if we get in such a place as that.”</p>

<p>“But there are some woods, aren’t there?” asked
Bony.</p>

<p>“Sure, woods, mountains, valleys, and all sorts
of wild places,” said Jack. “I fancy there’ll be
plenty of snow on the upper peaks, too, but it’s
likely to be nice and warm down below.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to shoot, Budge?” asked
Nat, for the gum-chewing youth had not said much.</p>

<p>“Hu! Guessarabbit’lldome.”</p>

<p>“A rabbit,” remarked Jack. “Maybe we’ll be
glad of a good rabbit stew, or one roasted, in case
these mighty hunters don’t bring down a buck or
a bear.”</p>

<p>Thus they talked for many miles, until they had
to change cars, where they took another road leading
more directly West. They arrived at Chicago
the morning after the day on which they had
started, and spent some time in the Windy City.
Then they started off again.</p>

<p>“Two days more and we’ll be in Wyoming,”
remarked Jack the next afternoon, as they were
speeding through Iowa. “Then for a good time.
Eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” answered Sam. “My, but I’m
getting stiff. I’d like to get out and have a ball
game.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” said Nat.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_112" href="#Page_112"><span title="112">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Their train stopped at a small station, and was
held there for some time.</p>

<p>“Wonder what we’re waiting for?” ventured
Jack. “What’s the matter?” he asked of a brakeman
who passed through their car at that moment.</p>

<p>“Some block on the line ahead,” was the reply.
“We’ll go in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>There was some fretting among the passengers
at the delay, but finally the train started off again.
It proceeded slowly. Then followed some sharp
whistles, and finally there sounded a report like a
gun.</p>

<p>“It’s a hold-up!” cried an excited man.</p>

<p>The boys and all about them leaped to their feet
in alarm.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” went on the man. “It’s
a Wild West hold-up! Better hide your watches
and money.”</p>

<p>He began emptying his pockets of his valuables,
and was thrusting them under his seat.</p>

<p>The train had come to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose it’s train robbers?” asked Bony
in some alarm.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jack. “I guess——”</p>

<p>“Where’sthegunsan’we’llshoot’em!” exclaimed
Budge, jumping up.</p>

<p>Just then a brakeman ran through the car, carrying
a red flag.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_113" href="#Page_113"><span title="113">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is it a hold-up? Are
they after our money?”</p>

<p>These questions were rapidly fired at him.</p>

<p>“A freight train has broken in two just ahead of
us,” explained the railroad man. “The engine’s
disabled,” he went on. “We’ve got to back up to
a switch so as to pass it. I’ve got to go back with
a danger flag.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed a woman. “But who
got shot? I’m sure I heard a gun go off.”</p>

<p>“That was a torpedo on the track, ma’am,” explained
the brakeman. “The freight crew put it
there on a sharp curve, so we wouldn’t run into
the tail-end of their train. It’s all right. There’s
no danger.”</p>

<p>The brakeman hurried down the steps of the
last car, in which the boys were riding, and began
to run along the track. When he was about a
hundred yards away the train began to back slowly
up.</p>

<p>“I wonder how far back we have to go to reach
the switch?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“About two miles,” answered a man across the
aisle from the lads. “It’s near Mine Brook Station,
and it’ll take us quite a while to get there.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Bony. “Can’t the train go fast
backward?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the engineer dare not run past the man
with the flag. He has to keep a certain distance<a class="pagenum" id="Page_114" href="#Page_114"><span title="114">&#160;</span></a>
in the rear of the last car, to warn any other trains
that may be approaching behind us. So we really
can’t back up any faster than the brakeman can
run. I don’t like this delay, either, as I have an
important engagement. But something always
seems to be happening on this road. I wish I’d
come another route.”</p>

<p>There were other grumbling remarks by the
various passengers, but the boys were too interested
in watching the brakeman to notice them.
The train must have gotten too close to him, for
it came to a stop, in obedience to a signal on the
air whistle, and waited until the man with the
red flag was out of sight around a curve. Then it
began to back again.</p>

<p>This was kept up for some time, and finally the
boys saw the brakeman come to a halt and wave his
flag in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>“He’s at the switch now,” remarked the man
who had first spoken to the lads. “We’ll soon
be on our way again.”</p>

<p>The train proceeded more slowly, and then the
boys saw where a switch crossed from one track
to another. The rear car was halted some distance
from the cross-over, and a man came running up
from the head end, carrying a key in his hand,
with which to unlock the switch. He quickly
turned it, and then began to wave his arm, as a signal<a class="pagenum" id="Page_115" href="#Page_115"><span title="115">&#160;</span></a>
for the engineer to back up. He continued to
wave for several seconds, and then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“He can’t see me. Hey!” he called to a group
of men on the back platform of the last car, “give
him the whistle signal, will you?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked a man.</p>

<p>“Give him the whistle. Blow it three times,
so he’ll back up. Hurry! I can’t leave this
switch.”</p>

<p>The men did not seem to know what to do.
Some of them began looking inside the car for the
old-fashioned bell cord, that used to run through
the train to the engineer’s cab. This is now
displaced by a small red cord at one side of the
car, and it operated a whistle connected with the
air-brake system.</p>

<p>“Pull the cord. Give him three whistles, can’t
you?” cried the man at the switch. “We can’t
lay here all day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any whistle,” murmured the man
who had told the boys about the switch. “Let him
come and pull it himself. This is a queer road,
where they expect the passengers to help run it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t some of you pull that whistle cord?”
demanded the man. “Hurry up.”</p>

<p>Jack heard and understood. He had often seen
the brakemen or conductor at the Denton station
start the trains by pulling on something under the
hood of the car, as they stood on the platform.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_116" href="#Page_116"><span title="116">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I guess I can do it,” he said as he worked his
way through the crowd of passengers about the
door.</p>

<p>He reached up, and his fingers encountered a
thin cord. He pulled it slowly, as he had seen the
railroad men do, for as the air pressure had to
travel the entire length of the train it required
some time, and a quick jerk would not have been
effective.</p>

<p>Once, twice, three times Jack pulled the whistle
cord, and he heard the hissing of escaping air that
told of the signal sounding in the locomotive cab.
An instant later came three blasts from the engine,
and the train began to back up.</p>

<p>“Much obliged to you,” called the man at the
switch to Jack, as the rear car passed him. “I’m
glad somebody knew how to work it.”</p>

<p>“Is that where the whistle cord is?” asked a
man. “I was looking for a bell cord.”</p>

<p>The train backed across the switch, and was
soon on another track, and one not blocked by a
disabled freight.</p>

<p>“Say,” remarked Nat to Jack, “you’re getting
to be a regular railroad man.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m in a hurry to get out to camp and
take the trail,” replied Jack. “That’s why I’m
helping ’em run this road.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_117" href="#Page_117"><span title="117">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>JACK MEETS A GIRL</small></h2>


<p>The train soon began to move forward again,
but it had to proceed slowly, as it was on the wrong
track, and a flagman had to precede it to prevent
a collision. It was tiresome traveling, and nearly
every one grumbled—that is, all save the boys.
To them the affair was novel enough to be interesting.</p>

<p>Finally they reached and passed the disabled
freight train. As they puffed past it a girl, who
had come in from some car ahead with an elderly
gentleman, took a seat with him just across from
where Jack sat.</p>

<p>“There, daddy,” said the girl in a sweet, resonant
voice that made Jack look up quickly, “there’s
the train that made all the trouble. Now we’ll
go more quickly.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Mabel?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, daddy. Didn’t the conductor say
that as soon as we passed the broken freight train
we would get on our regular track? You heard
him.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_118" href="#Page_118"><span title="118">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but you can’t always believe what
these railroad men tell you. They’d say anything
to keep a passenger quiet. I’m nervous riding in
these cars. There may be a collision when we’re
on the wrong track. Don’t you think so?” he
asked, turning to Jack.</p>

<p>“Why, no. I don’t believe we’re in any danger,”
replied our hero, and his heart beat faster at the
grateful look which the pretty girl flashed at him
from her brown eyes. “There is a flagman ahead
of us, and we’ll soon be on the right track. There
is no danger.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” went on the aged man.
“I’m not used to this way of traveling. A wagon,
a horse, or hitting the trail for mine. I came out
of the front car, because I thought it would be safer
here in case of a collision. Don’t you think so?”
he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Jack reassuringly, and
again the girl looked gratefully at him.</p>

<p>“My name’s Pierce,” went on the timid man.
“Dan Pierce. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy!” exclaimed the girl. “Perhaps
the young gentleman doesn’t want to tell his name.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he?” asked Mr.&#160;Pierce quickly.
“Every one ought to be proud of his name. I’m
proud of mine. Dan Pierce it is. I’m an old
Western hunter, and this is my daughter Mabel.
We’ve been East on a visit, and we’re going back.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_119" href="#Page_119"><span title="119">&#160;</span></a>
I’m glad of it, too. What’s your name?” he went
on.</p>

<p>“Father,” expostulated the girl, “perhaps he
doesn’t wish to tell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t the least objection,” answered
our hero. “I’m Jack Ranger, and these are some
friends of mine.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know ’em,” said Mr.&#160;Pierce quickly,
and Jack introduced the boys, the old hunter, in
turn, presenting his daughter Mabel, who blushed
more than ever. But Jack thought her ever so
much prettier when the color surged up into her
brown, olive-tinted cheeks.</p>

<p>“Going far?” asked Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p>

<p>“We’re taking a hunting trip to the Shoshone
Mountains,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so? Why, that’s where I lived
and hunted for forty years!” exclaimed Mr.&#160;Pierce.
“That’s where me and my daughter live. About
ten miles from Pryor’s Gap. But my hunting days
are over,” he said a bit sadly. “I have to settle
down now and live in a house with Mabel here.”</p>

<p>Jack thought that was not at all a bad arrangement,
and he stole a glance at the girl. He caught
her looking at him, and he felt the blood mounting
to his face, while he saw the blush spread again
over her cheeks.</p>

<p>“How long are you going to stay?” asked
Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_120" href="#Page_120"><span title="120">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Then Jack told of the formation of the gun club,
and how it happened that they had a chance to
come West on a late fall hunting trip.</p>

<p>“It makes me feel young again,” declared Mr.&#160;Pierce
as his eyes lighted up. “I declare, I’ve a
good notion to hit the trail again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t think of that, daddy!” exclaimed
Mabel. “Remember, you promised me
you would stay home now and rest.”</p>

<p>“Rest? I guess you mean rust,” said Mr.&#160;Pierce,
his deep-set eyes sparkling with fun. “I sure would
like to hit the trail again.”</p>

<p>“We would be very glad to have you come along
with us,” said Jack. “We have plenty of shelter
tents, and lots of grub.”</p>

<p>“I’d like it—I’d like it,” said Mr.&#160;Pierce
musingly.</p>

<p>“Daddy!” expostulated his daughter.</p>

<p>She shot a somewhat indignant glance at Jack
for proposing such a thing, but she was not angry.</p>

<p>“There, there, Mabel, of course I won’t go,”
said her father. “I’ll stay home. My hunting
days are over, I reckon, but I sure would like a
chance to wrassle with a bear or draw a bead on a
mule deer or a fine big-horn sheep. Say, if you
boys ever get near Pryor’s Gap I’ll feel mortal
offended if you don’t stop off and see us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stop,” promised Jack heartily, and he<a class="pagenum" id="Page_121" href="#Page_121"><span title="121">&#160;</span></a>
looked into Mabel’s eyes, whereat she blushed
again, and Jack felt his heart strangely beating.</p>

<p>“Masquerading mud-turtles! but that’s a fine
view!” suddenly exclaimed Nat, who was looking
from a window. “You can see fifty miles, I’ll
wager.”</p>

<p>Mabel laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“What a funny expression!” she said. “Where
did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he makes them up as he goes along,”
explained Jack, while Nat was in some confusion.</p>

<p>“It must be some tiresome,” observed Mr.&#160;Pierce,
while his eyes twinkled humorously. “But
we sure do have fine views out here. You needn’t
be in a hurry to look at ’em. There’s plenty where
you’re going. But I meant to ask you boys how
do you calculate to travel after you get to Fort
Custer? I believe you said you were going there
first.”</p>

<p>“We are,” replied Jack, “and from there we
have arranged to go in wagons to Sage Creek and
across Forty-mile Desert.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good route,” observed Mr.&#160;Pierce.
“Who was you depending on to tote your stuff
across the desert?”</p>

<p>“Why, a man named Isaac Blender,” answered
Jack. “I wrote to him on the advice of my father,
who heard of him through some Western friends
he has.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_122" href="#Page_122"><span title="122">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Oh, you mean Tanker Ike,” said Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p>

<p>“Tanker Ike?” repeated Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see, we call him that because he
used to drive a water tank across the desert to the
mining camps. So you’re going with Tanker Ike,
eh? Well, that’s middlin’ curious.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Because me and my daughter are going to take
a short trip with him. I’ve got a sister I want to
visit before I go back to Pryor’s Gap, and Mabel
and I are going in one of Tanker Ike’s wagons.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can go together,” spoke Jack quickly,
and he glanced at Mabel, who suddenly found
something of interest in the scenery that was rushing
by.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was thinking,” went on Mr.&#160;Pierce.
“I’ll give you a proper introduction to
Ike. Are you going to have a guide?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jack. “I wrote to Mr.&#160;Blender
about it, and he promised to get an Indian guide
for us. Do you think he can?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. There are plenty of Crow Indians
that can be hired. I’ll see that he gets you a good
one.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jack, secretly delighted that
he could travel for some time longer in Mabel’s
company.</p>

<p>The rest of the railroad journey seemed very
short to Jack, and to his chums also, for Mr.&#160;Pierce<a class="pagenum" id="Page_123" href="#Page_123"><span title="123">&#160;</span></a>
proved an interesting talker, and told them
many stories of camp and trail.</p>

<p>Finally they reached Fort Custer, found their
camping outfit on hand, with their guns, tents and
other necessaries, and there was Tanker Ike on
hand to meet them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ike!” called Mr.&#160;Pierce as he descended
from the car.</p>

<p>“Well, bust my off wheel! If it ain’t Dan
Pierce!” exclaimed the other. “Where did you
drift in from?”</p>

<p>They greeted each other heartily, and then Mr.&#160;Blender
approached Jack and his chums, Mr.&#160;Pierce
doing the introducing, which was hardly
necessary, as the man who was to pilot the boys
across the desert was a hearty, genial Westerner,
whom to meet once was to feel well acquainted
with.</p>

<p>“And I want you to get these boys a good Indian
guide,” said Mr.&#160;Pierce. “None of those lazy,
shiftless beggars.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got Long Gun for them,” said Mr.&#160;Blender.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mr.&#160;Pierce. “Long Gun is
as good a Crow Indian as there is. You’ll be safe
with him, boys.”</p>

<p>“Sanctimonious scalplocks!” exclaimed Nat.
“Are we going to travel with a real live Indian?”</p>

<p>“That’s what, son,” replied Tanker Ike softly.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_124" href="#Page_124"><span title="124">&#160;</span></a>
“But don’t let off any more of them curious expressions
than you can help. They might scare
Long Gun, and he’s sort of timid—for an Indian,”
and Mr.&#160;Pierce joined the wagon driver in a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re going to start we’d better be
going,” remarked Mr.&#160;Blender at length. “Let’s
see. I guess I can get you all in one wagon, and
pack the grub and camp truck in another.”</p>

<p>“Where will the Indian guide meet us?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“The other side of the desert.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll be there?”</p>

<p>“When Long Gun says a thing, it’s as good as
done,” commented Mr.&#160;Pierce. “Well, Mabel,
climb up, and I’ll get aboard in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Jack made a start for the wagon.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” asked Nat quickly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get in, of course.”</p>

<p>“But what about our stuff?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr.&#160;Blender will look after that, I guess.”</p>

<p>Jack kept on, following close after Mabel, and
he took a seat beside her in the big wagon.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” remarked Nat in a low voice
to the other lads, “what do you think of Jack?”</p>

<p>“He’s got ’em bad,” commented Sam. “But I
don’t know as I blame him. She’s awful nice.”</p>

<p>“Cut it out! You’re getting sentimental in your
old age, Sam,” objected Bony, as he cracked a
couple of knuckles for practice.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_125" href="#Page_125"><span title="125">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>A DANGEROUS DESCENT</small></h2>


<p>Jack looked down at his chums from his seat
in the big wagon beside Mabel.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to get aboard?” he asked with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Are we going to start soon?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“As soon as our stuff is loaded in the freight
wagon,” replied Jack. “Why?”</p>

<p>“I want to get my gun,” replied Nat. “We may
see something to shoot at.”</p>

<p>“Not much around here,” commented Mr.&#160;Pierce.
“Better leave your truck all together until
you get to camp. It’ll carry better that way.”</p>

<p>“Juthinkwe’llseeanyrobbers?” asked Budge suddenly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Mr.&#160;Pierce slowly,
while a look of surprise slowly spread over his
face. “But what was that remark you just made?”</p>

<p>For Budge had not talked much, thus far on the
journey, and when he had spoken he had not used
any of his conglomerated remarks.</p>

<p>“He merely inquired if you thought we’d see
any robbers,” answered Sam with a smile.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_126" href="#Page_126"><span title="126">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“’SwatIsaid,” added Budge, rapidly chewing
gum in his excitement.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t cal’alate we’ll meet up with any
bandits,” answered Mabel’s father with a smile.
“If we do—well, Tanker Ike and I are pretty well
heeled, I guess,” and he lifted from his side coat
pocket, where he carried it as if it was a pound
of sugar, a revolver of large size.</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy! Don’t bring out that horrid gun!”
exclaimed Mabel.</p>

<p>“I thought Western girls were used to guns and
such things,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“So she is,” said her father. “Mabel is as good
a shot with the rifle as I am, but somehow she don’t
exactly seem to cotton to these pocket pistols.”</p>

<p>“I think they’re dangerous,” explained the girl
with a glance at Jack that set his heart to beating
faster again. “I don’t mind a rifle, but for all
daddy says so, I’m not as good a shot as he is.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you shoot,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe you will—if you come to see me—I
mean us,” she corrected herself quickly, with a
blush.</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr.&#160;Blender and some men from
the railroad freight office were loading the other
wagon. This was one with a canvas top, something
like the prairie schooners of the early Western<a class="pagenum" id="Page_127" href="#Page_127"><span title="127">&#160;</span></a>
days, and was drawn by a team of four mules.
The passenger vehicle was hauled by four horses.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ve got everything in,” commented
Tanker Ike. “Now it’s up to you boys to
get the game. There’s plenty of it, and I expect
when you come back here to take a train East
you’ll have a great collection.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” sung out Mr.&#160;Blender, and Sam,
Bony and Budge, together with Nat, who had been
wandering about, looking at the view, started to
climb up into the big wagon. Jack had not relinquished
his seat by Mabel’s side, and he was
oblivious to the winks and grins of his chums.</p>

<p>“Have you got a good seat, Jack?” asked Sam,
giving Nat a nudge in the ribs.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the best seat in the wagon,” replied
Jack boldly, and Mabel seemed to find something
very interesting on the opposite side of the vehicle
from where Jack sat at her elbow.</p>

<p>Mr.&#160;Pierce and Mr.&#160;Blender took their places
on the front seat, the four other boys distributing
themselves in the rear, while a teamster in charge
of the freight wagon drove the mules that were to
haul the camping outfit over the desert and mountains.</p>

<p>It was fine, clear weather, not cold, in spite of
the lateness of the season, and the boys, as well as
all the others in the party, were in fine spirits.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_128" href="#Page_128"><span title="128">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Hurrah for Jack Ranger’s gun club!” cried
Nat, when they started off, the horses and mules
plunging forward in response to pistol-like cracks
of the long whips.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” sung out Sam.</p>

<p>“Is it your gun club?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p>“Well, they call it that,” explained Jack, as he
told how it came to be formed.</p>

<p>“Cæsar’s side saddles!” suddenly exclaimed Nat,
when they had gone a little farther. “Did you
see that rabbit? It was as big as a dog!”</p>

<p>“That’s a jack-rabbit,” explained Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I keep out my gun?” asked Sam
with regret in his voice. “I’d like a shot at it.
That’s the biggest game I’ve seen in some time.”</p>

<p>“Wait until you see a mule deer, or a big-horn
sheep,” said Mr.&#160;Blender. “Then you can talk.”</p>

<p>They continued on slowly for several miles, the
view changing every moment, and bringing forth
exclamations of astonishment and delight from the
boys. To Jack and Nat, who had been West
before, there was not so much novelty in it, but
Sam, Budge and Bony said they had never seen
such beautiful aspects of mountain and valley.</p>

<p>They stopped at noon to get dinner at a stage
station, and though the place was of the “rough
and ready” style, the meal was good.</p>

<p>“’Sanycowboys?” asked Budge of Jack, as they
came out to resume their journey.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_129" href="#Page_129"><span title="129">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I suppose you mean where are any cowboys,”
said Jack, and Budge nodded, being too busily engaged
in preparing a fresh wad of gum at that
moment to answer in words.</p>

<p>“There aren’t many around here,” explained
Mr.&#160;Pierce, who had heard Jack’s interpretation
of the question. “Oh, the West isn’t half so wild
and woolly as some book writers make it out to
be.”</p>

<p>“Are you boys pretty good at going dry?” asked
Tanker Ike, turning to Jack, when they had accomplished
several miles more of their journey.</p>

<p>“Going dry?” repeated our hero.</p>

<p>“Yes. Can you go without a drink if you have
to?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, we’ll start to cross the desert
to-morrow, and though we’ll take plenty of water
along, you never can tell what will happen. It
usually takes two days to make it, but sometimes
an accident happens to a wagon, or a horse or a
mule may go lame, and then you’re longer on the
trip. When you are, your water doesn’t always
last, and many a time I’ve finished the journey with
my tongue hanging out of my mouth, and the
poor beasts as dry as powder-horns. So I just
thought I’d ask you if you were pretty good at
going dry.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nat and I were shipwrecked once,” answered<a class="pagenum" id="Page_130" href="#Page_130"><span title="130">&#160;</span></a>
Jack, “and if it hadn’t rained we’d have
been in a bad way, eh, Nat?”</p>

<p>“That’s what. Sanctified sand-fleas! but that was
a tough time,” he added, as he thought of the
cruise of the <i>Polly Ann</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, it never rains on this desert,” commented
Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p>

<p>“Can’t you carry enough water so that if you’re
four days instead of two crossing the desert you’ll
have plenty?” asked Bony.</p>

<p>“You can only carry just so much,” replied
Tanker Ike. “But don’t worry. I was only asking
just for fun. I reckon we’ll make out all right.”</p>

<p>“Were you really shipwrecked?” asked Mabel,
interestedly turning to Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” he admitted, for he disliked to talk
about himself.</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell me about it, please. I love to
hear real stories of adventure.”</p>

<p>“And tell her how you knocked out Jerry
Chowden,” put in Sam. “Say, maybe we’ll meet
him out here. He went West, you know.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” responded Jack, and then he told
Mabel of his ocean cruise.</p>

<p>“Everybody hold on tight now,” cautioned Mr.&#160;Blender
about an hour later, as he set the brake
of the wagon and called back a warning to the
driver of the freight vehicle.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jack.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_131" href="#Page_131"><span title="131">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“There’s a bad hill just ahead, and I’ve got
more of a load on than I usually carry. But I
guess we’ll make it all right,” and he gathered
the reins in a firmer grip and braced himself on
the seat.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they came to a turn in the
road, and started down a dangerous descent of the
bluff that bordered the valley of the desert.</p>

<p>The brake began to screech on the wheels, and
the horses threw themselves almost on their
haunches to hold back the heavy wagon, which,
in spite of the fact that two wheels were almost
locked, was sliding down the declivity at a dangerous
speed.</p>

<p>“I’d oughter chained the wheels,” said Tanker
Ike grimly, as he tried to force the brake lever
forward another notch.</p>

<p>“Can’t you do it now?” asked Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p>

<p>“Nope!” spoke the driver between his clenched
teeth. “We’ve got to go on.”</p>

<p>More and more rapidly the vehicle slid down
the hill. The horses were slipping, but they managed
to keep their feet, and the brake was more
shrilly screeching on the wheels.</p>

<p>All at once, as they made a turn and came to
yet a steeper part of the trail, there was a sudden
chill to the air, and some white flecks, as if some
one had scattered tiny feathers, swirled in front
of those in the wagon.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_132" href="#Page_132"><span title="132">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Snow!” exclaimed Tanker Ike. “I thought it
was coming.”</p>

<p>A moment later there was a sharp squall, and the
air was filled with white crystals, which came down
so thick that it was impossible to see twenty feet
ahead.</p>

<p>“Steady, boys—steady!” called the driver to
the horses, which seemed frightened by the storm
and the weight of the wagon pushing them from
behind.</p>

<p>The speed was faster now, though Tanker Ike
was doing his best to have the animals hold back
the wagon. The horses were almost “sitting
down,” and were fairly sliding along.</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded a sharp snap, and the
wagon seemed to plunge forward.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p>

<p>“Brake’s busted!” shouted Mr.&#160;Blender. “Now
we’re in for it!”</p>

<p>He loosened his hold on the reins slightly, and
swung his long whip over the heads of the astonished
horses with a crack like that of a rifle.</p>

<p>“Go on!” he yelled. “Go on! Run!”</p>

<p>The steeds began to gallop, just in time to prevent
the wagon, so unexpectedly released from the
hold of the brake, from striking them, and they
dashed down the mountain-side, dragging the
vehicle after them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_133" href="#Page_133"><span title="133">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THIRSTY ON THE DESERT</small></h2>


<p>“Hold fast, everybody!” called out Tanker Ike,
giving one glance backward at his passengers.</p>

<p>The fury of the sudden storm increased. The
road became more steep, and the speed was faster.</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t meet any other wagon,”
thought Jack. He gave one glance at the
girl at his side. He could see that she was
pale, but there was no sign of fear in her brown
eyes. She was clinging tightly to the side of the
seat, and Jack edged closer to her, hoping he might
be of some service.</p>

<p>“Look out!” suddenly cried the driver.</p>

<p>An instant later Jack and his chums knew the
reason why. The wagon struck a big stone in the
road, and the occupants of the seats were nearly
thrown off them.</p>

<p>Then followed a sound as of something breaking,
and the next moment Jack felt the seat, on
which he and the girl were, sliding forward. It
had broken loose from its fastenings. Another
jolt of the wagon threw the end on which Mabel
sat down into the bottom of the vehicle, and she<a class="pagenum" id="Page_134" href="#Page_134"><span title="134">&#160;</span></a>
pitched sideways over the edge of the wagon, which
at that moment was on a narrow part of the road,
skirting a big cliff. On one side the rock rose
sheer like a wall. On the other there was a precipice,
dropping away for a hundred feet or more.</p>

<p>Mabel could not repress a scream as she felt
herself tossed out of the wagon, and she threw
her hands upward, vainly clutching for something
to cling to. Her father turned and saw her. He
prepared to leap backward to her aid, but he could
not have done it.</p>

<p>But Jack saw what had happened. His end of
the seat was elevated, as the other was depressed,
and, taking in the situation at a glance, he made a
spring toward the girl, and clasped her about the
waist just in time to prevent her falling out.</p>

<p>He braced himself against the edge of the
wagon, and held on with all his strength, for the
girl was no lightweight, and the swaying of the
vehicle threatened to toss them both out.</p>

<p>By this time Mr.&#160;Pierce had left his seat beside
Tanker Ike, who was doing his best to safely guide
the horses down the winding, steep road in the
storm, and Mabel’s father came to the aid of her
and Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ve got her!” Jack managed to gasp.</p>

<p>“So I see!” cried Mr.&#160;Pierce, and then, lending
his strength to that of our hero, he pulled Mabel
safely within the wagon.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_135" href="#Page_135"><span title="135">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“That—that was a narrow squeak,” commented
Mr.&#160;Pierce, when Mabel, pale and gasping from
fright, had been assisted to the seat, which was replaced
and braced up after a fashion.</p>

<p>“Rather,” admitted Jack with a smile.</p>

<p>“You saved her life, Ranger,” went on Mr.&#160;Pierce,
and there was a husky note in his voice.
“She’s—she’s all I’ve got, and—and—I don’t
know how to thank you. If she’d gone over the
edge there—well, I don’t like to talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I hadn’t grabbed her some one else
would,” said Jack modestly.</p>

<p>Mabel did not say much, but the glance she gave
Jack from her brown eyes more than repaid him.</p>

<p>The excitement caused by the second accident
calmed down, and then the occupants of the wagon
had time to notice that the progress of the vehicle
was slower. The road was not so steep, and a
little later Tanker Ike guided his horses to a comparatively
level stretch. The snow squall, too, suddenly
ceased.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the driver slowly as he halted
the team and got out to repair the broken brake,
“I don’t want a thing like that to happen again. I
wanted to help you, Mabel, but I didn’t dare leave
the horses.”</p>

<p>“I—I was helped in time,” answered the girl
with a little blush.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll wait for the freight wagon,” went<a class="pagenum" id="Page_136" href="#Page_136"><span title="136">&#160;</span></a>
on Tanker Ike. “Then I’ll fix things up and we’ll
go on. There’s no more danger, though. We’re
over the worst part of the road.”</p>

<p>Mexican Pete, who drove the freighter, soon
came up, he having had no mishap on the trip
down. The three men soon mended the broken
brake, and the journey was resumed. That night
they arrived at the stage station, which marked the
beginning of the two days’ trip over the desert.
It was here that Mr.&#160;Pierce and his daughter were
to leave the boys, to go on a different route.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you young fellows forget to come
to Pryor’s Gap if you get a chance,” commanded
Mr.&#160;Pierce. “My daughter and I will be there
in a few weeks, after I do a little more visiting.
You can get there from where you are going to
hunt without crossing this desert, though it’s rather
a long, roundabout way. But I hope I’ll see you
again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, try to come,” added Mabel as she shook
hands with the boys, Jack last of all.</p>

<p>Was it fancy, or did she leave her hand in his a
little longer than was absolutely necessary? I
rather think she did, or perhaps Jack held it.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll come to see me—I mean us,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” was Jack’s answer.</p>

<p>Mr.&#160;Pierce and his pretty daughter went to stay
with a friend that night, while the boys, Tanker<a class="pagenum" id="Page_137" href="#Page_137"><span title="137">&#160;</span></a>
Ike and Mexican Pete put up at the stage
hotel.</p>

<p>“We’ll start early in the morning,” said Mr.&#160;Blender
as the boys were getting ready to retire.
“I’ll see to filling the water tanks, and the grub
you ordered in advance is here. I’ll stack it in the
wagon, and we’ll start off as soon as it’s daylight.
I’ve got good horses for us all.”</p>

<p>“Horses? Are we going to ride horses?” asked
Sam.</p>

<p>“Of course, from now on,” replied Jack.
“Didn’t I tell you?”</p>

<p>“There’s so much about this trip, I guess if you
did tell us we’d forget some of it,” said Bony.
“But traveling on horses will be sport. I wish it
was morning. Don’t you, Budge?”</p>

<p>“I’mungry,” was the queer lad’s reply.</p>

<p>“Hungry?” remarked Jack. “Didn’t you eat
enough supper?”</p>

<p>“I guess it must be this Western air,” put in
Nat. “Salubrious centipedes! but I could eat a bit
myself. I wish we had some of that last spread
you gave, Jack.”</p>

<p>Then, though it was almost bedtime, the boys
went to the dining-room, where they bribed the only
waiter to set them out some pie, cheese and glasses
of milk, on which they regaled themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr.&#160;Blender and Mexican Pete had
loaded the freight wagon, which was to start off<a class="pagenum" id="Page_138" href="#Page_138"><span title="138">&#160;</span></a>
ahead of the travelers, who were to go on horseback.
They would catch up with the vehicle at
noon, and have dinner in the shade of it.</p>

<p>Jack aroused his companions next morning,
when there was only a faint light in the east.</p>

<p>“It’s time to start,” he said.</p>

<p>“How is it you’re dressed?” asked Sam suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I—er—I was up a little earlier,” replied
Jack.</p>

<p>“Say, I know where he was,” commented Bony,
cracking his knuckles in the semi-darkness. “He
was off to bid Mabel good-by again. I heard him
say last night he’d come over before the start of
the stage she was to take.”</p>

<p>“Masticated mushrooms!” exclaimed Nat. “I
wouldn’t have thought it of you, Jack!”</p>

<p>“Come on, get up!” was all Jack replied as he
hurried from the room to see if Tanker Ike had
everything prepared.</p>

<p>The boys, after a hasty breakfast, found the
horses in readiness for them. They had taken out
the night before their guns and some clothes from
the bundles shipped from the East, and now were
equipped to take the trail and begin hunting.</p>

<p>They started off some time before the sun shone
above the horizon, and almost immediately found
themselves upon a bare and partly sandy waste.</p>

<p>“This is Forty-mile desert,” explained Ike. “If<a class="pagenum" id="Page_139" href="#Page_139"><span title="139">&#160;</span></a>
you have any trouble at all, it’ll be here. But I hope
we won’t have any.”</p>

<p>It was warm, in spite of the lateness of the season,
and as they jogged along on their horses they
began to feel the discomfiture of the journey. But
no one minded it.</p>

<p>“We ought to come up with Mexican Pete soon,”
remarked Ike, when they had trotted along for
several miles. “That looks like the wagon over
there,” he added, pointing ahead. Jack and his
chums could make out a white speck on the trackless
waste. As they approached it grew larger,
until it evolved itself into the freight wagon.</p>

<p>They halted at it for a meal, and, resting the
horses, gave Pete a chance to get some distance
ahead of them. Then they resumed their jaunt.
It was the middle of the afternoon when Ike, who
was in the lead, made a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Mexican Pete’s just ahead,” replied the old
plainsman with a worried accent in his voice. “I
wonder what he’s stopping for? I told him not to
halt until we reached Stinking Spring, where we
are to camp for the night.”</p>

<p>“Maybe something’s happened,” suggested
Bony.</p>

<p>“I hope not, but it looks so.”</p>

<p>A moment later Tanker Ike had leaped from
his horse, and was examining something on the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_140" href="#Page_140"><span title="140">&#160;</span></a>
ground. It looked like a small streak of darker
sand than any which surrounded it.</p>

<p>“His water tank has sprung a leak!” he exclaimed.
“You can see where it’s been running
out. That’s why he’s halted to wait for us. Come
on, boys; let’s hurry up. I can see trouble ahead.”</p>

<p>They soon reached the driver of the freight
wagon. He met them with a rueful face.</p>

<p>“Water mos’ gone,” he said.</p>

<p>Tanker Ike made a hasty examination. There
was only a small quantity left in the second tank,
the full one, which had not yet been drawn upon,
being completely empty, from a leak that had
sprung in the bottom.</p>

<p>“Well, this is tough luck, boys,” commented the
plainsman. “I don’t know what to do. We’re
bound to be up against it bad whatever we do.
We haven’t hardly enough water to last us going
back for a fresh supply, and if we keep on we’ll
be awful dry by to-morrow night. I don’t like to
waste time going back, either.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say something about Stinking
Spring?” asked Jack. “Can’t we get water there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but neither man nor beast can drink it.
It’s filled with some kind of vile-smelling chemical,
and it gives off a gas so deadly that at times it
will kill animals that come too close. I’ve even
seen a big bear killed by it. No, we can’t get
water there.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_141" href="#Page_141"><span title="141">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Then what can we do?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>He and the other boys were alarmed by the
accident, the most serious that had yet befallen
them.</p>

<p>“Well, the only thing I see is for us to keep
on,” replied Ike. “If we travel all to-night and
keep up a pretty good pace to-morrow, we may
strike the Shoshone River in time to—well, in time
to wet our whistles. But it’s going to be a hard
pull, and I don’t know whether the horses will
stand it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try,” suggested Jack, who never believed
in giving up in the face of difficulties.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” commented Ike.
“Maybe we can do it.”</p>

<p>They halted for a short rest, then resumed the
journey again. But this time they kept with the
freight wagon, and they had to travel more slowly
to accommodate the pace of the horses to the
slower gait of the mules drawing the heavy vehicle.</p>

<p>They made a light supper, and drank sparingly
of the little water that remained, doling out the
smallest possible quantity to the horses and mules,
which greedily thrust their tongues even against
the wet sides of the pails, after all the fluid was
sucked up.</p>

<p>“Now for the night journey,” said Tanker Ike,
and they started off, with the moon shining from a
clear sky.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_142" href="#Page_142"><span title="142">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>It was a trip that would have been wonderfully
interesting to the boys had there not been the worry
about the water. As it was, they enjoyed it at
first, for in the cool, moon-lit darkness they did
not suffer from thirst. But when daylight came,
and the sun began to mount into the heavens, pouring
down considerable heat on them, their tortures
began.</p>

<p>Tanker Ike served out the water with sparing
hand. The animals were given barely enough to
wet their parched mouths, and the boys and two
men got but little more. They made all the speed
they could, which was not much, for the wagon
held them back.</p>

<p>“Don’t eat much,” cautioned Ike as they stopped
for a mid-day lunch. “You’ll not be so thirsty
then.”</p>

<p>But even refraining from food did not seem
to make much difference, and as the day wore
on and the supply of water became lower and
lower, with a consequent reduction of the ration,
the sufferings of the boys grew acute.</p>

<p>“Oh, for a good glass of ice water,” sighed
Bony.</p>

<p>“Dry up!” commanded Nat.</p>

<p>“I can’t be any drier than I am now,” responded
the bony lad.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tanker Ike had been anxiously<a class="pagenum" id="Page_143" href="#Page_143"><span title="143">&#160;</span></a>
scanning the horizon. He appeared worried, and
Jack, seeing this, asked him:</p>

<p>“Do you think we ought to be at the river now?”</p>

<p>“We ought to, yes, but we’re not,” was his
answer. “I’m afraid I’ve gotten off the trail. I
don’t see any familiar landmarks, yet I was sure
I took the right route.”</p>

<p>He called a halt and consulted with Mexican
Pete. That individual was of the same opinion
as Ike—that they were on the wrong trail.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no help for it,” said the plainsman.
“We’ll have to go back a ways. I’m sorry,
boys. It’s my fault. It’s the first time I ever did
a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mistakes will happen,” said Jack, and he
tried to speak cheerfully, but his voice was husky
and his throat was parched.</p>

<p>They turned around, the horses seeming unwilling
to retrace their steps, and they were beginning
to get restive, as were the mules.</p>

<p>“The last of the water,” announced Tanker Ike
at dusk that evening, when they halted for a short
meal. “We’ll have to push on with all speed to-night.
If we don’t find water in the morning——”</p>

<p>He did not finish, but they all knew what he
meant.</p>

<p>That night was one of fearful length, it seemed.
As it wore on, and the parched throats of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_144" href="#Page_144"><span title="144">&#160;</span></a>
travelers called for water where there was none,
it became a torture.</p>

<p>Morning came, and the sun blazed down hotter
than ever. The horses and mules acted as if
crazed, but they were urged on relentlessly. The
tongues of Jack and his comrades began to get
thick in their mouths. Those of the animals were
hanging out, and foam was falling from their lips
where the bits chafed.</p>

<p>At noon, though Tanker Ike strained his eyes
for a sight of the Shoshone River or for some
water hole, there was no sign of either. On and
on they pushed, trying to swallow to relieve their
terrible thirst.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horse which Sam rode gave a leap
forward, and then began to go around in a circle.</p>

<p>“That’s bad,” murmured Ike in a low voice.
“He’s beginning to get locoed from want of water.”</p>

<p>He urged his own beast up to Sam’s, and gave
the whirling animal a cut with the quirt. That
stopped it for a while, and they went on.</p>

<p>Mexican Pete and Tanker Ike said little. They
were men used to the hardships of the West, and
it was not the first time they had suffered in crossing
the desert. But it was hard for Jack and his
chums. Nevertheless, they did not complain, but
taking an example from the men, silently rode their
horses. The poor beasts must have suffered dreadfully.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_145" href="#Page_145"><span title="145">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Tanker Ike, who was riding ahead, suddenly
leaped off his horse. At first the boys thought
he had seen a water hole, but he merely picked up
some pebbles from the sand.</p>

<p>“Put some of these in your mouth and roll them
around,” he said. “It will help to make the saliva
come and keep down your thirst some.”</p>

<p>Mexican Pete followed his example, and the boys
were about to do likewise, when Budge Rankin,
reaching into his pocket, called out:</p>

<p>“What’smatterwithis?”</p>

<p>And he held out several packages.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_146" href="#Page_146"><span title="146">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>LOST IN THE BAD LANDS</small></h2>


<p>“Gum!” cried Jack. “Gum! That’s the stuff,
Budge!”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” added Tanker Ike. “I wonder
I didn’t think to ask for some. That will be
better than the pebbles. Pass it around, young
man.”</p>

<p>Budge handed out packages of gum, which he
was seldom without, and soon all the travelers were
busily engaged in chewing it. In a measure it relieved
their thirst at once, and their tongues felt
less swollen, and not so much like pieces of leather.</p>

<p>“’Stoobad,” remarked Budge as he put in a
fresh wad.</p>

<p>“What is?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“That the horses can’t chew,” replied Budge.</p>

<p>“Hu! I guess it would take a bigger cud than
you could muster to satisfy a horse—or a mule,”
remarked Tanker Ike. “But it’s lucky you had it
for us. I was feeling pretty bad.”</p>

<p>The little diversion caused by the production of
the gum and the relief it brought, helped them to
pass over several miles in a comfortable fashion.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_147" href="#Page_147"><span title="147">&#160;</span></a>
But the terrible thirst did not leave them, and as
for the horses and mules, they were half crazed,
or “locoed,” as Tanker Ike expressed it.</p>

<p>How they traveled the remainder of that day
none of them could tell exactly afterward. But
they managed to keep on, and just as it was beginning
to get dusk there was a sudden movement
among the animals.</p>

<p>“They smell water,” cried Ike as the mules,
drawing the heavy wagon, broke into a run. “They
smell water! They do, for sure!”</p>

<p>And he was right. Half an hour later they came
to a small water hole, and here they slaked their
thirst, drinking slowly at first, and keeping the
animals back from it by main force, until they had
each been given a pailful, which they drank greedily.
Then, after the life-giving fluid had had a
chance to take off the first pangs of thirst, boys,
men and horses drank more freely.</p>

<p>“Petrified persimmons!” exclaimed Nat. “I
used to think ice-cream sodas were the best ever,
but now I think a cupful of water from a mud hole
is the finest thing that ever came over the pike.
Let’s have another, boys!”</p>

<p>Their sufferings were at an end, and, their
thirsts having been slaked, they ate a good meal
and rested that night beside the water hole.</p>

<p>The next day they reached the Shoshone River
and the end of the desert.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_148" href="#Page_148"><span title="148">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Well, boys, now I’m going to leave you,” said
Tanker Ike. “Long Gun will be here pretty soon,
and he’ll show you where to get some big game.
Then you’ll have to sort of shift for yourselves.
Mexican Pete will take your camp stuff wherever
you tell him to, and the rest depends on you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we’ll make out all right,” replied
Jack.</p>

<p>“But what about that Indian, Long Gun?” asked
Sam. “I thought he was to meet us here.”</p>

<p>“He will,” replied Tanker Ike confidently, and,
sure enough, about an hour later there sauntered
into the camp a tall, silent Indian guide, who, as
he advanced to the fire, uttered but one word:</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“How?” responded the plainsman, and then he
introduced the boys.</p>

<p>Long Gun merely grunted his salutations, and
then seating himself near the fire, he took out his
pipe and began to smoke.</p>

<p>“I wonder why he doesn’t pass it around,” whispered
Nat to Jack.</p>

<p>“Pass what around?”</p>

<p>“His pipe? Isn’t that a peace pipe? I thought
Indians always smoked the pipe of peace with their
friends.”</p>

<p>Long Gun must have had good ears, for he
looked up at Nat’s words. Then he smiled grimly.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_149" href="#Page_149"><span title="149">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“No peace pipe. Corn-cob pipe—plenty bad,
too,” he said. “Yo’ got better one?”</p>

<p>“No, Long Gun, they don’t use pipes,” said
Tanker Ike with a smile.</p>

<p>“Say, he understands English,” remarked Sam.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” put in Bony.</p>

<p>“Pity he wouldn’t,” remarked Ike. “He’s been
guiding hunting parties of white men for the last
ten years.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning Tanker Ike started back,
taking a longer trail, that would not make it necessary
for him to cross the desert. On the advice of
Long Gun the boys and Mexican Pete started off
up into the mountains, where they were to make
a camp, and begin to hunt.</p>

<p>“Here good place,” remarked Long Gun that
afternoon, as they came to a level clearing on the
shoulder of the mountain. “Plenty much mule
deer and sheep here. Like um jack-rabbits, or um
bear? Plenty git here. We camp.”</p>

<p>“Hu! Good!” grunted Mexican Pete, and he
began to unload the wagon. In a short time all
the things Jack and the other boys had brought
were on the ground, beside the two tents that
formed part of their outfit.</p>

<p>“At last it begins to look like camping,” remarked
Bony.</p>

<p>“It’ll look a good deal more like it if you’ll give<a class="pagenum" id="Page_150" href="#Page_150"><span title="150">&#160;</span></a>
us a correct imitation of a fellow helping put up
a tent,” said Jack. “Every one get busy, now.”</p>

<p>Mexican Pete started back with the freight
wagon, agreeing to come and get the camp stuff
whenever word was sent to Tanker Ike or him.</p>

<p>They pitched in with a will, Budge helping to
good advantage, and soon the canvas shelters were
up, a fire built, and, under Jack’s direction, a meal
was in progress, Long Gun volunteering to oversee
this.</p>

<p>It was no novelty for the boys to sleep in a tent
at camp, but as the night advanced they found that
it was far from being summer, in spite of the
hot days, and they were glad of heavy clothing
and the blankets which they had brought along.</p>

<p>“Now for a hunt!” cried Jack the next morning,
after a fine, hot breakfast. “Long Gun, I want
to get a big mule deer.”</p>

<p>“I want a bear!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>“A big-horn sheep for mine!” was Nat’s stipulation.</p>

<p>“I’d like a mountain lion,” remarked Bony.</p>

<p>“How about you, Budge?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“’FIkillanelkI’llbesatisfied,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“An elk!” exclaimed Jack. “I guess so! Why,
I’d like that myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I might as well wish for something
big while I was at it,” said Budge calmly,
as he stowed away some fresh gum.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_151" href="#Page_151"><span title="151">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Under the guidance of Long Gun they mounted
their horses and started out for their first hunt in
that region. The Indian gave them some good
advice about how to shoot, for going after big
game was something new to them.</p>

<p>“If git lost, fire gun,” was the Indian’s final word
of caution.</p>

<p>They rode on together for a mile or more, but
got no sight of any game.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better separate,” suggested Jack.
“We’ll never get anything if we stick together.
Let’s try it alone. We can meet at some central
point. Eh, Long Gun?”</p>

<p>“Hu!” grunted the Indian. “Git lost, maybe.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Bony. “I don’t want
to go off alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nat and I will strike off to the left,”
went on Jack. “You, Sam and Budge can keep
with Long Gun and go to the right. We’ll meet
by that big peak over there,” and he pointed to
one that could easily be seen.</p>

<p>This was agreed to, the Indian giving his consent
with a grunt, and then Jack and Nat started
off alone.</p>

<p>“I hope we get something,” remarked Jack when
they had traveled for a mile or more.</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Nat. “Let’s go closer to
that bad lands section Long Gun told us of.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll get lost,” objected Jack.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_152" href="#Page_152"><span title="152">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>The bad lands, as they are called, are a peculiar
tract covered with ten thousand little sawtooth
peaks and cones of earth and sandstone, rising
abruptly from the plain, and so closely set together,
and so lacking in any distinctive objects
to mark them, that one can wander about in them
as in a maze. The two lads had been hunting on
the edge of them, but had not ventured in.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can find our way back, if we
don’t go in too far,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Jack a little doubtfully, “I don’t
know——” And then he saw something that made
him change his mind.</p>

<p>“Look!” he whispered to Nat, and his chum,
looking where Jack pointed, saw a big deer, just
on the edge of the bad lands, and about to enter
them.</p>

<p>“It’s a buck!” exclaimed Nat, bringing his rifle
around.</p>

<p>“We’ll follow him and get a shot,” decided Jack,
and they left their horses and began to stalk the
big buck. Fortunately the wind was blowing from
him to them, or the animal might have taken
fright. As it was, they were not far behind him
when he entered the maze of little peaks.</p>

<p>Several times they thought they were in a position
to get a good shot, but each time the deer
moved just as one or the other of the lads was
drawing a bead on him.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_153" href="#Page_153"><span title="153">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Finally Jack got just the chance he wanted.
Kneeling down he took quick aim and pulled the
trigger. The report that followed nearly deafened
him and Nat, so many were the echoes, but when
the smoke cleared away they saw the big deer
lying on the ground not far away.</p>

</div>

<p>“You’ve got him!” cried Nat.</p>

<p>“Our first big game!” exclaimed Jack as he ran
forward.</p>

<p>“My, but he’s big!” commented Nat. “How
we going back to camp?”</p>

<p>“Put him on the horses, of course,” said Jack.
“We can do it. We’ll lead them up here.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” responded Nat. “I forgot we had ’em.
We’ll go back and lead ’em in.”</p>

<p>They started back, full of confidence in their
ability to find where they had tethered the animals.
They walked on for half an hour, and then Jack
said:</p>

<p>“Say, it seems to me we’re a long time finding
those horses.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Nat. “We didn’t take
so long coming in here. I guess we came the
wrong way.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” declared Jack. “We should
have gone to the right.”</p>

<p>“No, the left.”</p>

<p>They discussed it for some time, and finally decided<a class="pagenum" id="Page_154" href="#Page_154"><span title="154">&#160;</span></a>
to try the right. They went on for some
distance, but no horses were seen.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back to where we left the deer and
begin over,” proposed Jack.</p>

<p>They started, but the sawtooth peaks seemed
to multiply. They turned this way and that, but
could not find the place where they had made their
first kill.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said Nat at length, “do you know it’s
getting late?”</p>

<p>“It sure is,” admitted his chum.</p>

<p>The sun was low in the western sky. The two
boys stared about them. On every side were the
peculiar peaks of the bad lands. Jack turned
around in a circle. He was trying to see some
landmark, by which he could tell whether they had
passed that spot before. He saw none.</p>

<p>“Nat,” he said finally, “we’re lost.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_155" href="#Page_155"><span title="155">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>A PERILOUS SLIDE</small></h2>


<p>For a few seconds after Jack’s announcement
Nat stared at his chum.</p>

<p>“Lost?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said, Nat. Long Gun was right,
and so was Tanker Ike. It’s a heap sight easier
to get lost in here than I thought. Why, every one
of these peaks looks just like the one next to it.
I don’t believe we’ve been over the same bit of
ground twice.”</p>

<p>“I know how we can tell.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Make a mark on one of these peaks, and then
walk around and see if we get back to it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good way, but in which direction
shall we go?”</p>

<p>Nat shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me,” he admitted. “But, say,
didn’t we come into this bad section from the east
when we were after the deer?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack after a little thought, “I believe
we did. I know when we were eating lunch<a class="pagenum" id="Page_156" href="#Page_156"><span title="156">&#160;</span></a>
I noted the sun. We sure did come in from the
east. But what of that?”</p>

<p>“Why, if we want to go back we must walk toward
the east. That is, have the sun at our backs.
Instead of that we’ve been walking with the sun
in our faces most of the time. Let’s try it.”</p>

<p>“All right, but first let’s make a mark on one
of these peaks.”</p>

<p>They did so by digging out a hollow with their
hunting knives, and placing some stones in it. This
accomplished, they started off again.</p>

<p>“What about the deer you shot?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“We’ll not try to get back to that. Make for
camp is what I say. Long Gun will probably be
able to find the deer.”</p>

<p>It was getting quite late now, and the sun was
barely visible from over the peaks of the bad lands.
But turning their backs to it they started off. They
did not know how far they went, but it was getting
dusk rapidly, and they saw no indication that they
were getting nearer to the edge of the curious
region in which they were lost.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Nat dejectedly as he sat down on
a stone. “How about it?”</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to be getting any closer to
camp,” admitted Jack. “Say!” he exclaimed,
“why didn’t we think of it before? We ought to
yell.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and fire our rifles,” added Nat. “That’s<a class="pagenum" id="Page_157" href="#Page_157"><span title="157">&#160;</span></a>
what Long Gun told us to do if we got lost.
Queer we didn’t think of it long ago. Well, here
goes!”</p>

<p>He raised his voice in a loud shout, and Jack
joined in. They called several times, but the
echoes seemed to be their only answer.</p>

<p>“Now let’s fire a few shots,” proposed Jack,
and they discharged their weapons together,
making a terrible din, and causing so many echoes
that it seemed as if a thunderstorm was in progress.</p>

<p>“I believe those echoes will confuse them,” said
Nat. “I know they would me.”</p>

<p>“I guess Long Gun can tell where we are if
he hears ’em at all,” replied Jack. “But I think
we’re quite a way from camp. I wish we’d stuck
together.”</p>

<p>“Too late for that now. Fire again.”</p>

<p>They did so, and also shouted a number of times,
moving about in the interval.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Nat at length as he noted the
shadows growing longer and longer, “I guess we’re
in for the night; and it’s getting colder, too.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, there,” answered Jack, turning
up the collar of his coat. “Still there’s one consolation.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t gone in a circle. We haven’t seen
anything of that peak we marked.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_158" href="#Page_158"><span title="158">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“No; but it will soon be so dark we can’t see
anything.”</p>

<p>The two lads gazed at each other. Their plight
was a serious one, for they were in no condition
to remain out in the cold night without shelter.</p>

<p>All at once, from somewhere off to the left,
there came a curious noise. It startled the lads,
and Nat exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jack. “Some sort
of an animal,” and in spite of himself he felt the
cold chills running down his spine.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a bear,” suggested Nat. “I
wish——”</p>

<p>The noise came again, louder than before, and
closer.</p>

<p>Jack burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we the ninnies?” he exclaimed. “Those
are our horses whinnying, and the echoes made
their calls sound strange. Now we’re all right,
Nat. We’ll find the horses and ride right to
camp.”</p>

<p>“My! but that’s good news!” responded his
companion.</p>

<p>Once more came the whinnying, and following
the direction of the sound, the lads soon came to
their horses, but, to their surprise, the steeds were
standing in among the sawtooth peaks of the bad
lands.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_159" href="#Page_159"><span title="159">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Didn’t we leave them outside, on the edge of
this pestiferous region?” asked Nat in some doubt.</p>

<p>“We sure did,” replied Jack, “but they’ve pulled
up the tether pegs and followed us in. Never mind,
they can probably find their way out. We’ll mount
them and let them take us back to camp.”</p>

<p>With hearts very much lighter, the two lads
leaped into the saddle, and calling to the horses,
let the reins lie lightly on their necks, trusting to
the superior intelligence of the beasts to extricate
them from their plight.</p>

<p>As if only waiting for their masters, the horses
started off. It was almost dark now, and one or
two early stars could be seen.</p>

<p>“Ho! for camp, and a good, hot supper!” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>“Jumping Johnniecakes! but you’re right!” cried
Nat with something of his old enthusiasm. “I
don’t believe I ever was so hungry.”</p>

<p>The horses walked at a fast pace, and seemed to
have no hesitation in making their way out of the
bad lands.</p>

<p>“Next time I’ll ride my horse in,” said Jack.
“I didn’t think it was good footing, or I’d have
done it to-day.”</p>

<p>They rode on for some time longer, and then
Nat remarked:</p>

<p>“Seems to me it’s taking quite a long while to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_160" href="#Page_160"><span title="160">&#160;</span></a>
get out of this place. The horses must have come
in quite a distance.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they did,” agreed Jack, “or maybe
they’re taking us out on the other side. I don’t
know as it makes much difference.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going up hill, anyhow,” went on
Nat. “It’s quite a grade.”</p>

<p>It certainly was, and the horses were having no
easy task. But they kept on, as if they knew just
where they were going.</p>

<p>The boys were beginning to get a bit anxious
again, wondering if, after all, the horses were
taking them right, when the bad lands came to a
sudden end. There were no more of the sawtooth
peaks.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, we’re out of ’em!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, and look where we are,” said Jack. “Nowhere
near camp.”</p>

<p>They were on the shoulder of a steep mountain,
while below them, wrapped in the fast approaching
night, was a great valley. Then something else
caught the eyes of the boys.</p>

<p>“There’s a fire!” called Nat, pointing to a blaze
at the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager it’s our camp,” declared Jack. “Here
goes for a hail.”</p>

<p>He shouted and fired his gun. In a few seconds
there came an answering call, and a firebrand was
waved in the air.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_161" href="#Page_161"><span title="161">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“That’s Bony’s voice,” cried Nat. “I can almost
hear him cracking his knuckle bones.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how are we to get down<ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: question mark added">?</ins>” asked Jack.  “I
don’t see the sign of a trail.”</p>

<p>The next instant his horse answered the question
for him by starting right down the side of the
mountain, which at that point was composed of
shaling stones, and quite smooth.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” cried Nat.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jack. “My horse
seems to want to take a slide.”</p>

<p>Then Nat’s steed followed the other, and a moment
later the two lads, on the backs of their animals,
were sliding, stumbling and slipping down
the precipitous slope of the mountain.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_162" href="#Page_162"><span title="162">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>LONG GUN IS AFRAID</small></h2>


<p>From below them Jack and Nat could hear cries
of alarm, and they could see several waving firebrands
and note ghostly figures circling about the
camp blaze.</p>

<p>“Can you stop your horse, Jack?” called Nat.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to try,” was the reply. “I’ve
got all I can do to hold on. How about you?”</p>

<p>“I’m in the same boat. I hope we don’t strike
anything, for if we do I’ll shoot over his head
and land I don’t know where. This is fierce!”</p>

<p>“Hold on tight!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m doing!”</p>

<p>The horses reached a place that was not quite
so steep, and managed to stop sliding, running for
a short distance. Then the slipping began again,
but both animals were like cats on their feet, and
seemed to take it all as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“We’re almost there!” cried Jack as he saw the
camp fire more plainly, and could distinguish Sam’s
and Bony’s voices calling to them.</p>

<p>“I’m—glad—of—that,” replied Ned brokenly,
for he was bounding up and down in the saddle.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_163" href="#Page_163"><span title="163">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>A minute later and the horses had come to a
stop on the level ground where the camp was
pitched.</p>

<p>“’Sanyoneurt?” asked Budge anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, I guess neither of us is hurt,” answered
Jack, “though we’re some shaken up.”</p>

<p>“Where in the world have you been?” asked
Bony.</p>

<p>“What did you come down that way for?” was
Sam’s question.</p>

<p>“Were you lost?” inquired Budge.</p>

<p>“Heap long time gone,” was Long Gun’s contribution.</p>

<p>“Say, if you’ll give us a chance we’ll tell you,”
said Jack. “I wonder if the horses are hurt,
though? I never expected to get down with them
alive.”</p>

<p>“Horses plenty much all right,” announced the
Indian after a short examination. “They do that
afore. Slide down mountain many times. Know
how—easy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad they knew how,” spoke Nat.
“I thought it was an accident.”</p>

<p>Then Jack told of the shooting of the deer, how
they were lost in the bad lands, and how they
found the horses and slid down to the camp fire.</p>

<p>Long Gun, in his broken English, explained that
the horses which they had were often used by
hunters, who thought nothing of sliding down a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_164" href="#Page_164"><span title="164">&#160;</span></a>
favorable place in the side of the mountain on the
backs of their steeds. Jack’s and Nat’s animals
had probably thought that their riders desired to
come down that way, as it was the shortest route
to camp and supper.</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly had us worried,” said Sam
as the two wanderers were seated before the fire,
eating a late meal. “We could hear your guns, but
the echoes confused us. Long Gun said you’d be
all right, but if you hadn’t come pretty soon Bony
and I were going after you.”</p>

<p>“Say, what about our deer, that you shot, Jack?”
asked Nat a little later. “Can’t we go get it?”</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” replied Jack. “I wouldn’t venture
in among those peaks in the dark for ten deer.
We’ll get it in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Hu! Mebby none left,” grunted the Indian.</p>

<p>“None left? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Plenty things eat um. Bears, rats, foxes,
mebby.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to shoot another, that’s all,”
said Jack. “But did you fellows have any luck?”</p>

<p>“Bony shot a jack-rabbit,” replied Sam, “but
the rest of us didn’t get anything, though I fired at
a big sheep.”</p>

<p>“Too far off,” explained Long Gun.</p>

<p>It was getting colder, and there was a promise
of snow in the air, which, the Indian explained,
would make it all the better for tracking game.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_165" href="#Page_165"><span title="165">&#160;</span></a>
The boys were glad to wrap themselves up well
when they went to their beds, which consisted of
heavy blankets spread over hemlock boughs, placed
inside the tent on the ground. A big camp fire
was kept going, with enough wood at hand, so
that if any one awakened in the night and found it
low the fuel could easily be thrown on.</p>

<p>The whole party, with Long Gun included, left
after breakfast to bring in the deer Jack had shot.
They found it without any trouble under Long
Gun’s guidance, but the carcass had been so torn
by other beasts that it was not fit for food.</p>

<p>“Rambunctious ram’s horns!” exclaimed Nat.
“I was counting on some nice venison steaks, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll try again,” suggested Jack, and the
whole party, on horseback, started off to hunt.</p>

<p>This time they did not go into the region of the
bad lands, but to an easy slope of the mountain,
well wooded, yet with rocky precipices here and
there, with bare spots where, the Indian said, the
big-horn sheep might be found.</p>

<p>On Long Gun’s advice the party separated, Jack,
Nat and Budge going off to one side, and the others
in a different direction. As there was a plain trail
back to camp, and plenty of landmarks, there was
no danger of any one getting lost.</p>

<p>Jack, Nat and Budge rode along, watching for
signs of game, but all they saw were numbers of
jack-rabbits.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_166" href="#Page_166"><span title="166">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“ShallIshoot’em?” asked Budge, as a particularly
large one dashed by.</p>

<p>“If you want to,” replied Jack. “But I’m going
to wait for bigger game. A buck or a ram for
mine, eh, Nat?”</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>But the bucks and the rams did not seem to be
on view that day, and after riding about all the
morning the three boys stopped to rest near a
spring and eat their lunch.</p>

<p>“I tell you what we’ll do,” suggested Jack as
they prepared to resume their journey. “Let’s
leave the horses here and work up that mountain,”
and he pointed to the steep sides of a towering
peak, at the foot of which they had halted.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” agreed Nat.</p>

<p>“<ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: apostrophe added">’</ins>Stoomuchwork,”
announced Budge as he turned over on his back and began chewing some fresh gum.
“I’ll stay here until you come back.”</p>

<p>They tried to get him to come with them, but
he would not, so Jack and Nat started off alone.
They had not gone more than a mile before Jack,
who was slightly in advance, came to a sudden halt
and motioned to Nat to make no noise.</p>

<p>“There he is,” whispered Jack, when Nat had
joined him, and he pointed to a distant boulder
that jutted out from the side of the mountain, a
short distance away.</p>

<p>Nat looked, and saw something that made the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_167" href="#Page_167"><span title="167">&#160;</span></a>
blood leap in his veins. It was a big mountain
ram, with a massive pair of horns—a fine specimen.
The animal’s back was toward them, and
it seemed to be viewing the valley spread out
below it.</p>

<p>“You shoot first, and if you miss I’ll take him,”
directed Jack in a whisper, wishing to give his
chum the first chance.</p>

<p>Fixing his eyes on the ram, Nat brought forward
his gun, cocked it, and aimed. Then for some unaccountable
reason his hand began to tremble. It
was his first shot at big game, and he was nervous.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t shoot,” he whispered, lowering his
rifle.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You’ve got to,” said Jack sternly,
and this brought Nat to himself. Once more he
raised his weapon. Jack was in readiness with his
in case his chum should miss.</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless suspense, and
then Nat fired. Instantly the ram wheeled about
and stood facing the spot where the two lads were.
He must have seen them, for the floating cloud of
smoke drew his gaze.</p>

<p>“I’ve missed! You fire!” exclaimed Nat.</p>

<p>And, indeed, he had missed the ram cleanly.
Jack threw his gun to his shoulder, and instantly it
cracked out.</p>

<p>“You hit him! I saw him jump!” cried Nat excitedly.
“Come on! We’ll get him!”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_168" href="#Page_168"><span title="168">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Without a word Jack pumped another cartridge
into the chamber, and fired again. But just as he
did so the ram gave a leap and disappeared from
the rock.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him! We’ve got him!” yelled Nat
excitedly. “Come on!”</p>

<p>“No use,” said Jack quietly, placing a restraining
hand on Nat’s arm.</p>

<p>“No use? Why?”</p>

<p>Jack pointed to a bare spot below the rock and
some distance to the right. Along it the ram was
running at full speed.</p>

<p>“Guess I only grazed him,” he said. “He isn’t
hurt much when he can run like that.”</p>

<p>“Side-splitting sandpaper!” exclaimed Nat.
“That’s tough luck. Why did I miss?”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing. I missed him, too. We can’t
hit everything we aim at, or it wouldn’t be any fun—especially
for the animals.”</p>

<p>“Let’s trail him,” proposed Nat.</p>

<p>“No, it’s too late. We’d better get back to
camp.”</p>

<p>They found Budge with the horses, and the gum-chewing
lad did not appear to have moved, but
three big dead jack-rabbits at his side showed that
he had not been idle.</p>

<p>“Well, you had some luck,” observed Jack.</p>

<p>“’Stooeasy—killin’ them,” remarked Budge.
“They are almost tame.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_169" href="#Page_169"><span title="169">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Well, they’ll make good eating,” observed Nat.
“I hope the others did better than we did.”</p>

<p>And when they were back at camp, which Long
Gun, Sam and Bony reached shortly after they did,
they found that Sam had killed a fine deer, and
Bony a small sheep, which gave them plenty of
fresh meat.</p>

<p>It was very dark that night, for it was cloudy,
and the moon and stars were obscured. Outside
the circle of light from the camp fire, there was
blackness so deep that it seemed like a wall of
ebony.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to be lost out there,” observed Bony,
motioning toward the dark valley as he prepared
to turn in with the others.</p>

<p>“Yes, it wouldn’t be very pleasant,” admitted
Jack. “I wish we could——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. From the black void
above them there came a peculiar sound. It was
like the blowing of a wind, that sighs and moans
in the pine trees, but there was no wind blowing.
Then it was like the rush of some mighty wings,
while there sounded a deep throbbing, and all in
camp were conscious of some large object passing
close over their heads, but they could see nothing.</p>

<p>The boys stared at each other in wonder, not unmixed
with fright.</p>

<p>“Are there any big eagles around here?” asked
Jack, quickly turning to Long Gun.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_170" href="#Page_170"><span title="170">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>But the Indian did not seem to hear. He was
staring up into the black sky.</p>

<p>The noise passed on, the throbbing becoming
fainter.</p>

<p>Then Long Gun cried out:</p>

<p>“Great spirit! Danger come! Bad luck!”</p>

<p>With a howl that did more to frighten the boys
than had the mysterious sound, the Indian made a
dive for the tent, and hid himself under his
blankets.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_171" href="#Page_171"><span title="171">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE DEADLY GAS</small></h2>


<p>Long Gun’s example and his fright were contagious,
to a certain degree. Seeing him run, Bony
and Sam turned also, for they thought the Indian
heard or recognized some danger. Then, as the
noise ceased, they stopped in their progress toward
the tent.</p>

<p>“What in the world do you suppose that was?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me,” was Bony’s answer, while, in
his excitement, he cracked his knuckles on the
double-quick. “What do you think it was, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know. It sounded like a big bird,
or, maybe, a whole lot of them. But Long Gun
wouldn’t be frightened of some birds, even if they
were eagles.”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask him,” suggested Nat.</p>

<p>They went into the tent, which was illuminated
by a couple of lanterns, and found Long Gun groveling
among his blankets.</p>

<p>“What was that, Long Gun?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>The Indian murmured something in his own
tongue.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_172" href="#Page_172"><span title="172">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Were they birds?” went on Jack. “What’s the
matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Long Gun ’fraid,” was the reply. “No like
sound in dark night. Long Gun ’fraid.”</p>

<p>“But what sound was it?” persisted Jack.</p>

<p>“Dunno. Great Spirit, mebby. Bad sound.
Trouble come.”</p>

<p>“That’s all nonsense,” said Jack, as he saw that
his chums looked worried. “It was probably the
wind.”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any wind,” declared Nat. “It’s
as still as can be.”</p>

<p>“Maybe there is a wind in the upper currents of
air,” suggested Jack. “You must remember we’re
among the mountains, and the air is different here.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t different enough to make a noise like
that,” was Sam’s opinion.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bony.</p>

<p>“Juthinkitwasacyclone?” asked Budge, all in one
word.</p>

<p>“A cyclone?” repeated Jack. “They don’t have
cyclones in the mountains. No, I think it was
birds.”</p>

<p>“No birds,” declared Long Gun suddenly.
“Birds not got wings go that way.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, it didn’t sound like birds’ wings,”
said Nat.</p>

<p>They discussed the mysterious happening for
some time further, but could arrive at no solution<a class="pagenum" id="Page_173" href="#Page_173"><span title="173">&#160;</span></a>
of it. Jack and Nat went out to look and listen,
but they could see nothing, of course, and the night
seemed very silent. As for Long Gun, he could
not be induced to come outside the tent.</p>

<p>The boys passed rather an uneasy night, but
fatigue finally made them sleep, in spite of their
alarm, and they slumbered so soundly toward
morning that no one awoke to replenish the camp
fire, which went out.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re all here and alive, at any rate,”
remarked Jack as he looked around on coming out
of the tent for a wash.</p>

<p>“Snapping sand-bars! but it’s cold!” cried Nat,
rubbing his benumbed fingers and threshing his
arms about. “Hi! Long Gun, are you so afraid
of the mysterious noise that you can’t build a fire?”</p>

<p>“Hu!” grunted the Indian as he came from the
tent, but he speedily had a genial blaze going, and
breakfast in preparation.</p>

<p>“Well, now for some more hunting,” said Jack
when the camp had been put in order. “Nat and
I want to get that ram we missed yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And I want to land a big buck mule deer that
I think I hit, but not hard enough,” said Sam.</p>

<p>They started off, and were gone all day, sometimes
hunting together, and, again, separating for
a few miles. But they had no luck, though Jack
got an opportunity for a couple of fine shots, missing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_174" href="#Page_174"><span title="174">&#160;</span></a>
both of them. However, they did not much
mind, as they had plenty of food in camp.</p>

<p>A day or so later, however, when Jack and Sam
were out together, Jack got the very chance he
wanted. They were walking along a rocky ridge,
and, coming to the edge of a deep ravine, were
debating whether to cross it or travel back, as they
had seen no signs of game, and it looked as if a
storm was brewing.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll go back,” Sam remarked. “There
doesn’t seem to be any——”</p>

<p>He looked around to see what Jack was doing,
and beheld his chum down on one knee, aiming at
something on a distant rock. Sam looked and saw,
outlined in the clear light, a big ram. He did not
speak, fearing to disconcert Jack’s aim, and the
next instant the rifle of his chum cracked.</p>

<p>The ram gave a convulsive leap into the air,
turned partly around, and then plunged over the
rock, and went rolling down the steep side of the
mountain.</p>

<p>“You got him, Jack! You got him!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>“It looks so,” admitted Jack with a smile of
triumph.</p>

<p>“And he’s a beaut!” went on Sam. “But how
will we get him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s just where we want him,” said Jack.
“Come on down.”</p>

<p>It was no easy task scrambling down the slope,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_175" href="#Page_175"><span title="175">&#160;</span></a>
at the bottom of which they had left their horses,
but they managed it, and then rode to the spot
where the ram had fallen. They found the body
in the bushes, and Sam saw that he had not misstated
it when he called it a “beaut.” The ram’s
head was graced with a fine pair of horns, which
Jack at once announced he would take back East
as a trophy.</p>

<p>“Put ’em in your room at Washington Hall,”
suggested Sam.</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied his chum.</p>

<p>It was difficult to get the ram back to camp, but
they managed it by constructing a sort of litter from
saplings, and having the horses pull it with ropes,
dragging it along behind them. They found on
their arrival that the others had not yet reached
camp, and sat down to wait for them.</p>

<p>Presently Long Gun, Nat and Bony came in.</p>

<p>“Where’s Budge?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Why, he went off shooting jack-rabbits,” explained
Nat. “He said he’d be over near the
river, down by the tall pine. He seems to like to
pop over those rabbits better than going after big
game.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a walk down there and tell him to
come in to supper,” said Jack. “Come on, Nat.
I guess we had all the luck to-day, Sam.”</p>

<p>This was true, for Long Gun and the others
had not been able to shoot anything.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_176" href="#Page_176"><span title="176">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p><del class="correction">At</del><ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has “At”">As</ins> Jack and Nat
advanced toward the river, which was about half a mile from camp, Nat suddenly
called out:</p>

<p>“What’s that smell?”</p>

<p>“Whew! It isn’t very nice,” declared Jack as
he took a long sniff. “No wonder they used to
call this place Stinking Water before they named
it the Shoshone.”</p>

<p>“What makes it smell so?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Well, I understand there are springs around
here, the water of which is impregnated with
sulphureted hydrogen.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. Sulphureted hydrogen! Humpty-doodle’s
hydrangeas! I thought it smelled like
the chemical laboratory at Washington Hall. Is
it the river?”</p>

<p>“No, only some small springs, and some of
them give off gases that kill animals. But there’s
the tree where Budge ought to be. I s’pose he’s
asleep.”</p>

<p>As they approached nearer the unpleasant odor
became more pronounced. Then, as they topped a
little mound, they looked down and saw their
friend reclining on the ground near a dead cottonwood
tree.</p>

<p>“Sure enough, he’s asleep,” remarked Jack.
“Come on, we’ll wake him up. Get close, and then
we’ll yell like wild Indians and scare him.”</p>

<p>They crept softly closer to the outstretched<a class="pagenum" id="Page_177" href="#Page_177"><span title="177">&#160;</span></a>
Budge. He did not stir. Then they united their
voices in a terrorizing yell.</p>

<p>But instead of Budge sitting up suddenly he remained
in the same position, his gun by his side,
and a couple of dead rabbits at his feet.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” remarked Jack. “He’s certainly
sleeping sound.”</p>

<p>He tiptoed up to his chum, and bending over
looked closely at him. He was struck by the paleness
of his face and the fact that Budge did not
seem to breathe.</p>

<p>“Nat!” called Jack quickly, “he’s dead! He’s
fallen asleep and been killed by those poisonous
gases!”</p>

<p>Nat ran up. It did seem as if Budge was dead.</p>

<p>“We must carry him away from here,” said
Jack sadly.</p>

<p>“I—I begin to feel rather faint myself,” said
Nat as he sat down on the ground.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_178" href="#Page_178"><span title="178">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER</small></h2>


<p>Jack glanced at Nat. The lad was pale, and
Jack himself began to feel the effect of the poisonous
gas. But he made up his mind he would not
give in.</p>

<p>“Brace up, Nat!” he cried. “We must get
Budge out of here. Maybe he’s only fainted.
Brace up! It will only take us a minute, and then
we’ll get where there is better air.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Nat faintly.</p>

<p>He stood up, and by a strong effort fought off
the feeling of faintness. Then he and Jack reached
down and took hold of Budge, lifting him by his
head and feet. His gun was strapped over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“There’s what did the mischief,” said Jack, and
he nodded toward a spring, about five feet in
diameter, near which Budge had been sitting when
he had been overcome.</p>

<p>The poor lad’s body was limp, and it was hard
to carry him, but Nat and Jack strained and staggered
along. As they went on, the effect of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_179" href="#Page_179"><span title="179">&#160;</span></a>
deadly gas became less, and soon they could breathe
better.</p>

<p>“Do you—do you think he’s dead?” faltered
Nat.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” answered Jack, but his voice was
serious. “It depends on how long he has breathed
that gas. I heard Tanker Ike say he once saw a
grizzly bear killed by it, so it must be pretty powerful.”</p>

<p>“Have we got to carry him back to camp?”</p>

<p>“No, we’ll take him out of the reach of the
vapor, and then one of us can run back and get the
medicine chest. I’ll try some strong ammonia on
him. That may revive him—if he isn’t dead.”</p>

<p>A little later they staggered with the limp body
of Budge out on a clear place, where the fumes of
the gas could not be noticed.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait here with him until you run to camp,”
said Jack, and when Nat, who had recovered from
his faintness, had started off, Jack chafed Budge’s
hands, and running to the river filled his cap with
cold water, which he dashed into the face of the
unconscious lad.</p>

<p>This treatment was effective in a measure, for
Budge opened his eyes. Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t drown me!”</p>

<p>“Budge! Budge!” cried Jack. “Do you feel
better?”</p>

<p>But the lad’s eyes closed again, and Jack feared<a class="pagenum" id="Page_180" href="#Page_180"><span title="180">&#160;</span></a>
that it was but a momentary reviving. He chafed
the lad’s hands again, and tried to force some cold
water from the river between his set teeth.</p>

<p>Then Nat came running back, bearing a medicine
box, which Mr.&#160;Ranger had insisted that Jack take
with him. Long Gun, Sam and Bony followed.</p>

<p>Jack took out a bottle of ammonia, and held it
beneath the nose of Budge. The powerful liquid
fumes made Budge gasp, and he struggled to sit
up.</p>

<p>“Hi! quit!” he called. “Don’t burn me!” For
the ammonia stung him.</p>

<p>“Oh, he isn’t dead!” cried Nat, much relieved.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon be all right,” said Long Gun, who
had been told what had happened. “Plenty much
fresh air make um well.”</p>

<p>And he seemed to be right, for presently Budge
sat up, opened his eyes, and began feeling in his
pockets.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Where’smygum?” was what Budge wanted to
know, and his companions laughed.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re all right when you can chew
gum,” spoke Jack. “But what made you go over
by that sulphur spring?”</p>

<p>“I was shooting jack-rabbits,” explained Budge,
“and I thought that would be a good place. I
didn’t like the smell, but pretty soon I fell asleep,
and then——”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_181" href="#Page_181"><span title="181">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Yes, and then if Jack and Nat hadn’t come
along you’d be sleeping yet,” added Sam.</p>

<p>“’Sright,” admitted Budge.</p>

<p>They helped him back to camp, and he was soon
feeling better, but he registered a firm resolve
not to go too near the deadly gas spring again.
Hunting was over for the day, and they were all
soon gathered about the camp fire, telling their various
experiences.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the night when Jack, who
was rather restless, was awakened suddenly. At
first he thought some one had called him, but as he
raised up and looked over at his sleeping companions
he realized that none of them were awake.</p>

<p>“I wonder what that noise was?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>Just then he heard, in the air above the tent, that
same sighing, throbbing sound that had so startled
them on a previous occasion. It was like the passage
of some immense body through the air.</p>

<p>Jack, who was partly dressed, hurried to the
flap of the tent. He peered upward into the blackness
of the night.</p>

<p>Was it fancy, or did he see some great, mysterious
shape moving over the camp? He could not
tell, but the throbbing, swishing noise became
fainter.</p>

<p>“I wonder what that is?” thought Jack as he
went back to bed. In the morning he did not tell<a class="pagenum" id="Page_182" href="#Page_182"><span title="182">&#160;</span></a>
his chums nor Long Gun of the affair, fearing to
frighten them.</p>

<p>They prepared for a big hunt the next day.
There was a light fall of snow, which the Indian
guide said would serve to enable them to track the
game. They were out early in the morning on their
horses, and were gone all day, keeping together.
Jack shot a big buck, and Bony, to his great delight,
brought down a fine mountain sheep, while the
others had to be content with jack-rabbits.</p>

<p>Budge had entirely recovered from the effects
of the deadly gas, but he said he felt too nervous
to do any shooting, so he and Long Gun, who, despite
his name, was a poor shot, simply trailed along
in the rear.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get another pair of big horns for
my room,” said Jack toward the close of the day.
“What do you think, Long Gun, have we time to
go a little farther and try for a big ram?”</p>

<p>“Hu! Mebby,” answered the Indian. “Plenty
sheep been here,” and he pointed to where the animals
had scraped away the snow to get at the grass
and shrubs beneath.</p>

<p>Jack and Nat started off, while the others made
a temporary camp and warmed some tea. They
were to stay there until Jack and Nat returned,
which the lads promised to do within an hour if
they saw no signs of sheep.</p>

<p>They tramped on, having left their horses in the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_183" href="#Page_183"><span title="183">&#160;</span></a>
temporary camp, Jack eagerly watching for a sign
of a big pair of horns.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m not going to find them this time,”
he said as he mounted a pinnacle of rock and looked
about him. “It looks like a good place, too,” he
added.</p>

<p>“Hark, something’s coming,” said Nat in a
whisper.</p>

<p>There was a crackling in the bushes to Jack’s
right. He turned in that direction, his rifle in readiness.
Something was moving there. Was it a
mountain sheep?</p>

<p>He raised his gun. A dark object could be seen
to be moving behind the screen of bushes, and the
snow on them was shaken off.</p>

<p>Suddenly there stepped into view, not a mountain
sheep, but the figure of a lad, all in tatters.</p>

<p>For an instant Jack and Nat stared at the youth.
He had appeared so unexpectedly that they did not
know what to say. On his part, the lad stood there
silent, as if he did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Then Jack threw down his rifle and sprang forward,
at the same time crying out:</p>

<p>“Bill! It’s Bill Williams! Well, how in the
world did you ever get here?”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_184" href="#Page_184"><span title="184">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>ANOTHER NIGHT SCARE</small></h2>


<p>Will Williams, the strange, new boy, whom
Jack had last seen at Washington Hall, now so far
away, rushed forward.</p>

<p>“Jack Ranger!” he gasped, as if he could not
believe it.</p>

<p>“That’s who I am,” responded our hero. “But,
Bill, what has happened? You look as if you were
suffering.”</p>

<p>“I am suffering,” was the answer. “I’m almost
starved!”</p>

<p>“Starved!” exclaimed Nat. “Wobble-sided
watermelons! And our camp just filled with good
things! Come on, Bill. We’ll feed you up.”</p>

<p>The two chums clasped Will successively by the
hand. Then Jack asked:</p>

<p>“How did you get away out here? The last I
heard of you was when I received a letter and a
telegram from your guardian, asking me to send
you home if I saw you.”</p>

<p>“You—you’re not going to—are you?” faltered
Will.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_185" href="#Page_185"><span title="185">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Am I?” Jack clasped his arm about the shrinking
form of the unfortunate lad. “Well, I guess
not! I’d like to have that guardian of yours here,
for about five minutes!”</p>

<p>“Petrified pancakes! So would I!” exclaimed
Nat. “I’d send him over where that bad-smelling
spring is to spend the night. But, Bill, you haven’t
told us how you got here.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know myself,” was the answer. “I
did run away, just as Mr.&#160;Gabel told you, Jack.
I couldn’t stand his mean ways any longer. He
refused to let me go camping with you, and said
I would have to go to work, while school was closed
for repairs, to make up the money he said I stole.
I decided I would come out West and try to find
my uncle. He’s out here somewhere, but where
I haven’t been able to learn. I had a few dollars
saved up, that I had earned, and I came as far as
they would bring me. Then I worked my way on
from Chicago by jumping freights and by doing
odd jobs whenever I got the chance. I heard, in a
roundabout way, that my uncle was either in the
southern part of Montana, or the northern part of
Wyoming, and so I came on. I’ve been traveling
around now for two weeks, trying to find him, and
I’ve been living like a tramp, but I can’t seem to
locate him. I met some men who said they knew
him, but they acted so mysterious that I could get
no information from them. They didn’t seem to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_186" href="#Page_186"><span title="186">&#160;</span></a>
want to tell me where he was. So I decided to keep
on until I found him. I’ve been tramping all day,
and when I heard you talking I thought maybe
you were a party of hunters who would help me.”</p>

<p>“And so we will,” burst out Jack. “Come along
to camp with us, Bill, and we’ll fix you up. It’s a
shame, the way your guardian treats you. And
your uncle can’t be much better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he used to be kind to me,” said the unfortunate
lad, “but I don’t believe he knows how
things have gone with me. If I could find him I
think he would take care of me.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we can help find him for you,”
said Nat.</p>

<p>Little time was lost in getting back to the temporary
camp, and there Will, who was weak and
faint from hunger, was given a light meal. Then
the whole party went on to the main camp, Will
riding behind Jack, for the latter’s horse would
carry double.</p>

<p>“My, but you certainly are doing this up in
style,” remarked the ragged lad as he saw the
fine tents and noted how comfortably Jack and his
chums lived, in spite of the fact that they were far
from civilization. His arrival created quite a sensation.</p>

<p>“Oh, when Jack Ranger does a thing, it’s done
good and proper,” said Bony. “It’s the first outing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_187" href="#Page_187"><span title="187">&#160;</span></a>
out of the gun club, and he wants to make a
record, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I want you all to have a good time, that’s all
I want,” was Jack’s reply.</p>

<p>Some better clothes were found for Will, and
after a good meal some of the hopelessness faded
from his face. He told of his wanderings in the
mountains, and how he had worked his way from
camp to camp, and from stage station to stage
station.</p>

<p>“But you’re done tramping around now,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Have you—have you got room for me here?”
faltered Will.</p>

<p>“Have we? Well, I guess!” was Jack’s hearty
answer. “You can stay here as long as you like,
or until you find your uncle. You’ve accepted my
invitation to come camping, after all, and I guess
your guardian would be surprised if he could see
you now.”</p>

<p>“I guess he would,” remarked Will with a
smile.</p>

<p>There was plenty of room in the big sleeping
tent, and a bed was made up for the wanderer.
It was the first good night’s rest he had had in
nearly a week, he said.</p>

<p>As they had plenty of fresh meat in camp they
did not go hunting for several days, but Jack and
his chums could not remain inactive, so they all,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_188" href="#Page_188"><span title="188">&#160;</span></a>
including Will, went on short jaunts about the
camp. A gun was provided for the newcomer, and
he proved that he was a good shot, at least on jack-rabbits,
which abounded in that region.</p>

<p>About a week after Will had joined his former
chums they went on an all-day hunt. The luck
fell to Bony and Sam this trip, for each of them
killed a fine mountain ram, the horns of which
were equal in size to the one slain by Jack.</p>

<p>Nat killed a small deer, and Will was delighted
when he also brought one down.</p>

<p>“Plenty much game,” observed Long Gun. “No
need hunt right ’way ’gin.”</p>

<p>“I guess Long Gun is getting tired,” observed
Jack. “Well, of course we don’t want to kill just
for the sake of killing, so I think we will take a
few days off.”</p>

<p>The weather continued fine, being clear, and
not too cold, while there was no deep snow to hamper
the movements of the members of the gun
club, though there were several light flurries. The
lads went out on short trips, Will riding the horse
assigned to Budge, for the latter was not a very
enthusiastic sportsman, and would rather remain
in camp, stretched on his back, chewing gum, than
go after deer or mountain sheep.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jack one night, about a week
after the last hunt, “I think we’ll go out again to-morrow<a class="pagenum" id="Page_189" href="#Page_189"><span title="189">&#160;</span></a>
and try to fill up the cupboard again.
Supplies of fresh meat are running low.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” commented Nat. “Maybe you
can get another ram with horns to match your first
pair.”</p>

<p>Jack was successful in this venture, for after a
long day’s jaunt he got a fine shot, just at sunset,
bowling over a large ram. They took the head
and horns back to camp, leaving the carcass to be
brought in the next morning, having first taken the
precaution, however, of tying the choicest portions
high in a tree, out of the reach of marauding
animals.</p>

<p>As they were all gathered about the camp fire
that night, discussing the events of the day, Jack
suddenly held up his hand to insure silence.</p>

<p>“Hark!” he exclaimed. “There’s that queer
sound again.”</p>

<p>In the air over their heads was the rushing of
great wings, while there was a throbbing as if some
mighty beast was passing over the camp.</p>

<p>“Wow!” cried Long Gun, and he made a dive
for the tent.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” said Nat softly. “I wonder if we
shall ever solve the mystery?”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in alarm. Will
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“That sound!” he cried. “I heard it one night
when I was camping in the woods.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_190" href="#Page_190"><span title="190">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Where?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“About ten miles from here. It’s the same
noise.”</p>

<p>“We must solve this mystery!” exclaimed Jack.
“I believe it must be——”</p>

<p>But he did not finish the sentence, for from the
air above them sounded the call of a voice:</p>

<p>“To the left! To the left!” was the cry.
“There’s the camp fire we saw before.”</p>

<p>They all sprang to their feet and looked up into
the dark sky. Surely that was some vast shape
hovering over them! And then the throbbing and
the rush of wings died away.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_191" href="#Page_191"><span title="191">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>JACK GETS A BEAR</small></h2>


<p>“Fellows,” spoke Jack, and his voice trembled
in spite of his efforts to render it steady, “we’ve
got to get at the bottom of this.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bony.</p>

<p>“Maybe Bill can tell us something,” suggested
Sam.</p>

<p>“Long Gun ought to know something about it.
He’s lived around here all his life,” said Budge,
speaking plainly this time.</p>

<p>“Long Gun thinks it’s spirits or something like
that,” remarked Jack. “He’s so scared he can’t
speak. But what about you, Bill? Are you sure
you heard it before?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the newcomer. “I heard that
same noise about a week ago. I was in a lumber
camp, to which I had worked my way, and one
night, just about this time, we all heard that rushing
sound in the air. Some of the men were frightened,
but others said it was a flight of eagles or
other big birds.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_192" href="#Page_192"><span title="192">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“That’s what we thought it was, first,” came
from Nat. “But I don’t believe it now.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Bony. “It’s the same
sound.”</p>

<p>“But did you hear some men speaking?” demanded
Nat. “We didn’t hear that before.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s right,” agreed Jack. “And the
voices were quite plain, as if they were close at
hand.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they were chasing the peculiar creature,
whatever it was,” suggested Sam.</p>

<p>“That might be it,” Jack said.</p>

<p>“Let’s give ’em a hail,” put in Bony.</p>

<p>The boys thought this a good idea, and united
their voices in a loud shout. After that they fired
their rifles in a volley, but no answer came back.</p>

<p>“Either they don’t hear us, or they don’t want
to answer us,” commented Jack.</p>

<p>“Or else that big bird or beast, whatever it was
they were chasing, has eaten them up,” suggested
Budge, preparing to stow away a fresh wad of
gum.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Nat. “I don’t believe
it was a big bird.”</p>

<p>“Waitansee,” was all Budge said.</p>

<p>Though the boys discussed the matter for some
time longer, they could arrive at no satisfactory
explanation. As for Long Gun, it was useless to
ask him his opinion of the mysterious noise. He<a class="pagenum" id="Page_193" href="#Page_193"><span title="193">&#160;</span></a>
cowered under his blankets, murmured something
about “bad spirits,” and predicted that evil would
befall any one who sought to solve the secret.</p>

<p>The night was not disturbed by any further
alarms, and they were all up bright and early the
next morning, with fine appetites.</p>

<p>“The big bird, or whatever it was, didn’t steal
any of us,” remarked Jack as he was washing for
breakfast. “I hope it didn’t steal the ram I shot
yesterday. We must go after that meat as soon
as we have breakfast.”</p>

<p>Leaving Budge and Long Gun in camp, the
others went to where Jack and Nat had slain the
ram. It was quite a long ride, and they took their
time.</p>

<p>“Look here, Jack,” called Nat, as, riding slightly
in advance, he was first to arrive at where the carcass
had been tied in a tree. “Something’s been
here at it. There’s none of it left.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” cried Jack, riding up.</p>

<p>“Sure. You can see it’s gone.”</p>

<p>The boys dismounted and went closer to the
tree. There was no doubt but that the choice portions
of the ram were gone. And at the foot of
the tree the dirt was trampled down as if whatever
it was that had stolen the meat had been put to
considerable trouble to get it.</p>

<p>“It was a bear that took it!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Jack.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_194" href="#Page_194"><span title="194">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Look where he climbed the tree. The bark’s
torn off with his claws, and you can see the marks
of his paws in the soft dirt.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Nat. “Lopsided lollypops!
but it must have been a big one, too! Look
where the first marks of his claws begin,” and he
pointed to abrasions in the bark a good distance
above the ground.</p>

<p>“Do bears eat meat?” asked Bony, cracking all
his finger knuckles excitedly.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, I believe,” answered Jack. “Anyway,
if the bear that stole my ram didn’t get it for
himself he must have pulled it down for some
friends of his.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Here are the marks of footsteps,” went on
Jack, “and they aren’t ours, either. Look, whoever
made these had heavy boots with hobnails in
them, made in the shape of an arrow.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the ground. There, in addition
to the paw-marks left by the bear, were footprints,
clearly to be seen, and it needed but a glance to
show that they had not been made by any of the
boys or Long Gun.</p>

<p>“Some one—some men, that is—have been here
since Nat and I were here yesterday,” went on
Jack. “Either they or the bear took the ram.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they were the men we heard yelling
last night,” suggested Nat.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_195" href="#Page_195"><span title="195">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Yes, and maybe they have a trained bear, that
goes around stealing meat for them,” added Sam
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t get such crazy ideas,” objected Nat.</p>

<p>“Well, that might happen,” went on Sam. “Almost
anything is likely to happen in this queer
country. I wonder what we’d better do about it?”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to trail that bear. He’s left plenty
of marks, and maybe I can get a shot at him. I
owe him something for taking my meat, and he’ll
make a good substitute.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” cried Bony. “I’m
with you, Jack.”</p>

<p>The marks of the bear’s paws were plainly
visible for some distance, leading off to the right,
and up the sloping side of a mountain. As for
the footprints of the man or men, they were soon
lost to sight. But the boys decided to trail the
bear. They lost the marks after about a mile, but
arguing that the beast would make nearly a straight
line for his den, after he had the meat, the young
hunters laid their course as well as they could by
compass and kept on.</p>

<p>They had to travel slowly, because the road was
not very good for the horses, and at noon they
had not come up to bruin. Eating a light lunch,
they kept on, and it was mid-afternoon when Jack,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_196" href="#Page_196"><span title="196">&#160;</span></a>
who was ahead, noticed that his horse suddenly
stopped and began to shiver.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he cried, “we’re near the bear.
That’s what ails the horse.”</p>

<p>The other steeds began to exhibit signs of terror,
so it was decided to dismount and lead them back
a short distance.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay with the horses,” volunteered Bony.
“I—er—I don’t exactly feel up to hunting bears
to-day.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid, are you?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly. You might call it—out of
practice,” and Bony began cracking his knuckles.</p>

<p>They tried to persuade him to go with them,
but he would not, so Jack, Will, Nat and Sam went
on. It did not take much searching to discover a
trail leading farther up the side of the mountain,
and following this a little way they smelled the
unmistakable odor of wild animals.</p>

<p>“His cave’s near here,” whispered Jack.</p>

<p>They came in sight of it a moment later, and
then there was no doubt as to who had stolen part
of the ram. For in front of a black opening in
the side of the big hill was a portion of the carcass.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’s in there?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll wish he wasn’t,” commented Sam.</p>

<p>“I will not,” was Jack’s bold reply. “I’m going
to get a shot at him now.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get him out?”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_197" href="#Page_197"><span title="197">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>Jack quickly made a torch of some dry bark,
and lighting it, tossed it into the mouth of the cave.
Then he ran quickly back, and with his chums stood
waiting with ready rifle.</p>

<p>“We’d better separate a bit,” said Nat. “If he
comes out with a rush, and you miss him, Jack,
we can take a crack at him.”</p>

<p>This was voted good advice, and Sam, Will and
Nat moved down the slope a short distance, leaving
Jack nearer the cave.</p>

<p>“I guess he isn’t going to come out,” called Jack
to his chums. “He’s asleep, maybe. I’ll try to
wake him up.”</p>

<p>He caught up a large stone, and tossed it into
the cave. Hardly had he done so than there sounded
a series of angry growls, and with a loud
“woof!” bruin appeared at the mouth of the cavern,
his little eyes glistening with wrath, and the
fur on his back raised in a long ridge.</p>

<p>“Shoot him, Jack!” cried Nat.</p>

<p>But Jack did not need this advice. Dropping on
one knee he took quick aim and pulled the trigger.
At the sound of the shot bruin lurched forward,
and without the loss of a second Jack pumped in
another cartridge and let him have it right in the
head.</p>

<p>Then the big, tawny brute, with a scream,
launched himself forward, and doubling up into a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_198" href="#Page_198"><span title="198">&#160;</span></a>
ball, began to roll down the mountain-side, straight
toward where Sam and Nat stood.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Jack, for he saw that the
bear was in his death struggle, and might attack his
chums.</p>

<p>Sam and Nat needed no warning, but as they
turned to get out of the way of the infuriated creature,
Nat’s foot slipped. He fell, and, to save
himself, he clutched at Sam. They both went
down in a heap, rolling over and over, but a few
feet in front of the bear, that came bounding after
them, clawing up dirt, stones and little shrubs as
it tried to stay its progress.</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_199" href="#Page_199"><span title="199">&#160;</span></a></p>
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>SOME PECULIAR MARKS</small></h2>


<p>“Shoot! Shoot!” cried Will Williams, who
had remained to one side. “Shoot him again,
Jack!”</p>

<p>“I can’t! I may hit Sam or Nat!”</p>

<p>Jack did not know what to do. He and Will
had to stand there and watch their chums rolling
and slipping down the mountain-side, with the
bear, in its death struggle, slowly gaining on them.</p>

<p>Suddenly the beast struck a large boulder, bounded
up into the air, and came down nearly on top
of the two lads. Jack’s heart almost stopped beating,
and Will turned his head aside. Bear and
boys seemed to be in one indistinguishable heap.</p>

<p>“They’ll be killed!” cried Will.</p>

<p>Jack started down the hill on the run. He had
not taken a dozen steps, his gaze all the while fixed
on that heap, which had now reached a little ledge,
where it came to a stop, when he saw Sam and Nat
slowly extricate themselves.</p>

<p>“They’re alive, anyway,” he murmured.</p>

<p>He heard Will following after him, but did not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_200" href="#Page_200"><span title="200">&#160;</span></a>
look back. He wanted to see what the bear would
do. Sam and Nat appeared bewildered, but Jack
noticed that they moved away from bruin. The
brute was quiet.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I killed him?” thought Jack. Then
he called out: “Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“As a door-nail,” replied Sam.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” sung out Will.</p>

<p>“Only bruised some,” answered Sam, rubbing
several places on his body.</p>

<p>By this time Jack had reached his chums. Their
clothing was disheveled, and their hands and faces
were covered with dirt, but the bear had not
harmed them.</p>

<p>“I thought it was all up with you,” said Jack
with relief in his voice.</p>

<p>“So did I,” admitted Nat. “But I guess that
bear was dead when he started to roll. It was
when it hit us, anyway, for it never made a move.
It rolled right on top of us, and Sam yelled——”</p>

<p>“So did you,” spoke Sam quickly. “You were
just as frightened as I was.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” admitted Nat. “But you
got your bear, all right, Jack.”</p>

<p>They looked at the dead animal. It was a large
grizzly.</p>

<p>“Another trophy for the gun club,” remarked
Sam. “Say, we’re doing all right for amateurs.
Jack’s new organization is a success.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_201" href="#Page_201"><span title="201">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“It’s all to the bear steaks!” exclaimed Nat with
a grin, as he gently caressed his elbow, where the
skin was rubbed off.</p>

<p>“How are we going to get this back to camp?”
asked Will.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can pile it on the horses,” said
Nat.</p>

<p>“Not until it’s cut up,” remarked Jack. “Did
you ever try to lift a dead bear?”</p>

<p>None of them had, and when they tried to raise
the lifeless bruin they found it beyond their
strength. They had keen hunting knives with
them, however, and soon had the bear skinned
and the choicest portions cut off. Jack took the
skin, intending to have a rug made of it. Then the
horses were brought up, and the meat tied on the
backs of the saddles. Satisfied with their day’s
hunt thus far, the boys headed for camp, Will getting
a shot at a fine ram on the way back, but missing
it, much to his regret.</p>

<p>“Better luck next time,” consoled Jack.</p>

<p>Long Gun and Budge had a fine supper ready
for the young hunters, and never was a meal better
enjoyed. Then, as it grew dark, they all sat about
the camp fire, listening to the story of killing the
bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is the kind of life to lead,” said Nat
with a sigh. “It’s simply perfect.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_202" href="#Page_202"><span title="202">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“And to think that we’ll soon have to go back
to Washington Hall,” put in Bony.</p>

<p>“I know where Jack would rather be than here,”
said Sam with a grin barely visible in the flickering
light of the camp fire.</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Over at Pryor’s Gap, where a certain girl with
brown eyes——”</p>

<p>Plunk!</p>

<p>A wad of dried leaves took Sam squarely in the
face.</p>

<p>“You dry up!” commanded Jack as he looked
around for another missile.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course; but I thought you’d like to be
reminded of her,” went on Sam.</p>

<p>“I guess he can think of her without you reminding
him,” added Nat.</p>

<p>“I’m going to turn in,” announced Jack suddenly,
and the laughs of his chums did not seem
to disconcert him. They all retired a few minutes
later and slept soundly.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the program to-day?” asked Sam
as they stepped from the tent the next morning into
the cold, crisp air. “Hello,” he added, “it’s been
snowing again.”</p>

<p>“Plenty good for track sheep,” announced Long
Gun.</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t need any fresh meat. What’s
the use of going hunting again?” asked Jack.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_203" href="#Page_203"><span title="203">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“What will we do, then—go fishing?” demanded
Nat.</p>

<p>“I have an idea that it would be fun to take a
trip back over the mountain,” went on Jack.
“We’ve never been in that direction.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite a climb,” said Bony as he looked up
the immense hill, at the foot of which they were
camped.</p>

<p>“I know it, but Long Gun says there’s a good
trail, and we can go on our horses and take it easy.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say let’s go,” put in Will. “I heard there
was some sort of a camp over there, and maybe I
could get a trace of my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go,” decided Jack. “What sort of
a camp is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. I met a man during my
wanderings who told me he had been delivering
supplies at a camp over on the eastern slope of
Rattlesnake Mountain. This is Rattlesnake Mountain,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s the name it goes by,” said Jack. “But
what sort of supplies did he take?”</p>

<p>“That’s the queer part of it. He couldn’t tell.
They were in boxes, and he was never allowed to
go very close to the camp. He always had to halt
quite a way off, leave his stuff and drive away.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” commented Jack. “I wonder if
that can have anything to do with——”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_204" href="#Page_204"><span title="204">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Then he stopped suddenly, without finishing his
sentence.</p>

<p>“Well, with what?” asked Bony.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied Jack as he began oiling
his gun. “Let’s get ready to go over the top of
the mountain.”</p>

<p>They found it a hard climb, but they took it by
degrees and did not hurry the horses, who were
used to mountain trails. They reached the summit
at noon, and after a rest and lunch, they started
down the slope.</p>

<p>The newly-fallen snow made a white mantle over
the earth, and it was undisturbed by any marks
until they came along.</p>

<p>“No signs of game,” said Jack, “but I guess we
don’t need any. Long Gun and Budge will be able
to get up a good supper with what’s in camp,” for
the Indian and the gum-chewing lad had remained
behind.</p>

<p>They traveled on for a few miles farther, admiring
the view of a much more wild and desolate
country than was visible on the side of the mountain
where they were staying.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’d better turn back,” called
Sam as he noted that the sun was getting low in
the sky.</p>

<p>“No; let’s ride down to that little level spot
and look over,” proposed Jack. “Then we’ll come
back.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_205" href="#Page_205"><span title="205">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>They were not long in reaching the place. Nat,
who had urged his horse ahead, was the first to
get to it. Suddenly he pulled his animal back and
uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“What is it?” called Jack.</p>

<p>“Some peculiar tracks,” replied Nat. “Look
here!”</p>

<p>They all rode up. There in the snow were many
strange marks. The white crystals were scattered,
and in some places the ground was swept bare.
In other spots there were many footprints.</p>

<p>“See!” cried Jack. “The man with the arrow
made in hobnails on the soles of his shoes has been
here!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the impressions.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s been a fight or a struggle here,”
added Sam. And, indeed, it did seem so, for in
some places the ground was torn up, the dirt being
scattered over the snow.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_206" href="#Page_206"><span title="206">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>THE SPRING TRAP</small></h2>


<p>For several moments the boys gazed in silence
at the strange marks they had come across. Then
Jack said:</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, we seem to be up against some
more of that mystery.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Bony. “Do you think this has
anything to do with the other?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You mean the strange sound we heard at
night?” asked Will.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” went on Jack. “I think we are
on the track of something queer.”</p>

<p>“And do you intend to look further?” was Nat’s
query.</p>

<p>“Well, not to-day,” answered Jack. “But I will
sooner or later. I believe something happened
here which has to do with that queer disturbance
we have heard several times. What it is I don’t
know, but I’m going to find out.”</p>

<p>“Say, I have an idea,” came from Bony.</p>

<p>“Don’t let it get away from you,” advised Nat.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_207" href="#Page_207"><span title="207">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“No, I’m serious,” went on the lanky youth.
“I think these men have some strange beast or
bird in captivity, and that it gets away from them
at times. Maybe that’s what happened here, and
they had to fight to capture it again.”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense!” exclaimed Sam.</p>

<p>“Not so nonsensical, either,” Jack hastened to
say. “If it was an immense bird, like a big eagle,
it would account for the noises we heard—at least,
some of them.”</p>

<p>“But there is no eagle large enough for men to
ride on its back,” objected Nat.</p>

<p>“How do you know men were on its back?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t we hear them call and speak about our
camp fire? How could they see it unless they were
up high in the air, on the back of some big bird?”</p>

<p>“They might have been on some point of the
mountain above us,” said Bony. “They could have
the eagle, or whatever it was, tied by a cord.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Nat; “but I don’t believe it’s a
bird.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” came from Sam. “But what is
it?”</p>

<p>“Let’s look at the marks a little more carefully,”
proposed Jack.</p>

<p>“Several men have been here, struggling with
the—the—er—whatever it was,” spoke Will. “See
the different footprints.”</p>

<p>That much was evident. In addition to the man<a class="pagenum" id="Page_208" href="#Page_208"><span title="208">&#160;</span></a>
with the mark on his shoes of the arrow in hobnails,
there were tracks of several other individuals.</p>

<p>“And if this isn’t the mark of a big bird’s wing,
I’ll eat a pair of snowshoes!” exclaimed Nat suddenly.
“Look here, fellows!”</p>

<p>They hurried to where he was. There in the
snow was the unmistakable print of what seemed
to be a wing of a great creature of the air.</p>

<p>“And here’s another wing,” added Sam a little
later as he walked slowly over the level place.
“But they’re some distance apart.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” agreed Jack. “Sixty feet, if
they’re an inch.”</p>

<p>“But the marks are those of two wings, and they
were made at the same time,” went on Sam.
“Look, you can see where the body comes between
the wings. The bird was over on its back. That
happened when they tried to secure it.”</p>

<p>“But sixty feet,” objected Nat. “There’s no
bird living with a spread of wings like that. It’s
out of the question.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the evidence,” spoke Sam obstinately.
“You can see for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Sixty feet spread,” murmured Jack. “It
doesn’t seem possible.”</p>

<p>But there was no doubt but that the marks in
the snow were those of wings, and, as Jack paced
the distance from tip to tip, they proved to be over
sixty feet apart.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_209" href="#Page_209"><span title="209">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Maybe the men have discovered some prehistoric
monster,” suggested Will, “and are trying
to subdue it so they can exhibit it. There used
to be monsters as large as the marks left by this
thing, whatever it is.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Jack; “but they disappeared
from the earth ages ago. Only their fossil remains
are to be found now.”</p>

<p>“But might one not be alive, by chance, in some
big mountain cave?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” spoke Jack with a worried look.
“It has me puzzled, fellows. I don’t know what
to think.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back to camp, tell Long Gun about
it, and bring him here to-morrow to see it,” suggested
Sam.</p>

<p>“Long Gun would never come,” said Jack.
“He’s too much afraid of bad spirits. No, boys,
we’ll have to solve this ourselves, if it’s to be
solved at all.”</p>

<p>The boys walked around the little level place,
whereon there was the mute evidence of some
terrific struggle.</p>

<p>“The queer part of it is,” said Sam, “that the
footsteps of the men don’t seem to go anywhere,
nor come from anywhere. Look, they begin here,
and they end over there, as if they had dropped
down from the clouds and had gone up again on
the back of the big bird.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_210" href="#Page_210"><span title="210">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Jack looked more thoughtful. As Sam had said,
there were no marks of the men coming or going,
and they could not have reached the level place, nor
departed from it, without leaving some marks in
the tell-tale snow.</p>

<p>“I give it up!” exclaimed Jack. “Let’s get back
to camp. It’s getting late.”</p>

<p>They started, talking of nothing on the way but
the mystery, and becoming more and more tangled
the more they discussed it.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk when they came in sight of
the camp fire, and they saw Budge and the Indian
busy at something to one side of the blaze.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they’re up to now?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, probably Budge is teaching Long Gun
how to chew gum,” was Nat’s opinion.</p>

<p>A moment later something happened. Budge
seemed to shoot through the air, as if blown up
in an explosion. He shot over the top of a small
tree, and coming down on the other side, hung suspended
by one foot.</p>

<p>“Help me down! Help me down!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Jack, spurring his
horse forward.</p>

<p>“I’m caught!” answered Budge.</p>

<p>“It certainly does look so,” spoke Nat, and he
could not refrain from laughing at the odd spectacle
Budge presented as he hung by one leg in a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_211" href="#Page_211"><span title="211">&#160;</span></a>
rope that was fast to the top of a tree, which bent
like a bow with his weight.</p>

<p>“Take me down!” wailed the unfortunate one.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Long Gun made a spring trap,” gasped Budge,
“and—and——”</p>

<p>“And you wanted to try it,” finished Jack, as he
went to his chum’s aid.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_212" href="#Page_212"><span title="212">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Hurry up and get me down!” pleaded Budge,
as he tried to grasp the sapling with his hands, to
ease the strain on his foot.</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” replied Jack, who was laughing
heartily. “Guess I’ll have to cut the tree down,
though.”</p>

<p>“No; I have a better plan than that,” spoke
Will. “I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>In another moment he was climbing up the thin
trunk of the hickory that served to hold Budge
Rankin suspended. Then Will’s plan was apparent.
As he climbed up farther, his weight, added to
that of Budge, caused the sapling to sway toward
the ground.</p>

<p>“Grab me and cut the rope!” cried Budge.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Jack, and when his queer
chum was near enough to him, Jack seized him
around the waist. Nat, with his hunting knife,
severed the thongs of deer sinew from which Long
Gun had made the loop. Then Budge was released,
and he assumed an upright position on the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_213" href="#Page_213"><span title="213">&#160;</span></a>
ground, while Will dropped from the bending
tree, which straightway sprang back to its place.</p>

<p>“Hu!” grunted Long Gun, with just the suspicion
of a smile on his copper-colored face. “Boy
go up heap fast.”</p>

<p>“’Sright,” admitted Budge, while he began
hunting through his pockets for a piece of gum.</p>

<p>“What in the world did you ever put your foot
in that trap for?” asked Jack, when it was ascertained
that Budge had not been injured.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I’ll tell you. You see, I asked
Long Gun to show me how to make a spring trap.
I thought it might come in handy when I got back
home. He showed me, and made one. But it
didn’t look to me as if it would work. So I just
touched the trigger with my foot, and—and——”</p>

<p>“We saw the rest,” finished Bony. “Cracky!
But I thought at first you were giving us an exhibition
of a human skyrocket.”</p>

<p>“Or trying to imitate the gigantic bird that left
the marks in the snow,” added Sam. “Let’s tell
Budge about it.”</p>

<p>Which they did; and as his chum was usually
pretty sharp in his conclusions, Jack asked him
what he thought it was that had made the mysterious
prints in the snow.</p>

<p>“It must have been a roc, one of those birds
you read about in the ‘Arabian Nights,’” declared
Budge.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_214" href="#Page_214"><span title="214">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“There never were such birds,” objected Jack.</p>

<p>“Sure there were,” declared Budge. “It says
so in the book.”</p>

<p>“No one ever saw one,” objected Sam.</p>

<p>“No, and you never saw George Washington,”
spoke Budge quickly. “But you’re sure he was here
once, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“This is different,” remarked Bony.</p>

<p>“’Sallright. You’ll find that’s a big bird, like a
roc,” declared Budge, while he began to help the
Indian get supper.</p>

<p>They discussed, until quite late that night, the
cause of the mysterious noises they had heard, and
also what peculiar bird or beast had had the struggle
with the men. Then Jack finally declared:</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use of wasting our breath over
it? We can’t decide what it was. There’s only one
thing to do.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Try and find out what it was.”</p>

<p>“How can we?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got two plans. One is to make another
trip on the other side of the mountain, and
go farther next time. We can search for some sort
of a camp.”</p>

<p>“And the other plan?” asked Will.</p>

<p>“Is to keep watch, and see if we hear that thing
passing over our camp again. If we do, we’ll<a class="pagenum" id="Page_215" href="#Page_215"><span title="215">&#160;</span></a>
throw a lot of light wood on the fire, and when it
blazes up we may catch sight of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” declared Nat. “We’ll
take turns keeping watch at night, and we’ll begin
right away.”</p>

<p>They agreed that this was a good plan, and the
night was divided into six watches, one for each
of the lads, as Long Gun positively refused to have
anything to do with seeking a solution of the
mystery. Some light wood was collected and piled
near the camp fire, in readiness to throw on, so
as to produce a bright blaze the moment the queer
noise was heard in the air overhead.</p>

<p>But that night passed without incident, and so
did the three following. During the day the boys
went hunting in the forest, or fishing in the Shoshone
River, having fairly good luck both on land
and in the water.</p>

<p>It was about a week after Jack’s plan of keeping
night watches had been in effect, that something
happened. He had about given up hearing the
noise again, and was about ready to propose that
the next day they should go on a trip over the
mountain.</p>

<p>It was Jack’s watch, and he was sitting by the
camp fire, thinking of his father, his aunts and
matters at home, and, it must be confessed, of a
certain brown-eyed girl.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_216" href="#Page_216"><span title="216">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I must take a trip over to Pryor’s Gap and see
her,” he said softly to himself.</p>

<p>The fire was burning low, and Jack arose to put
on some more wood. As he did so he heard a vibration
in the air, not far above the camp. Then
came what seemed to be a whirr of wings and a
throbbing noise.</p>

<p>“The mystery! The mystery!” cried Jack, tossing
an armful of light wood on the embers.</p>

<p>The fire blazed up at once, and Jack looked upward.
He saw a great shape hovering over the
camp, a shape that was fully sixty feet wide, and
he knew he could not be mistaken, for there were
the gigantic wings flapping. The object was flying
right across the valley.</p>

<p>Will, Sam and Nat rushed from the tent. They
had heard Jack’s cry.</p>

<p>“Do you see it?” the watcher demanded. “Right
up there!”</p>

<p>The fire blazed up more brightly, and in the
glare of it could be dimly seen something like a
great bird.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Nat. “Gasolened grasshoppers!
but what is it?”</p>

<p>No one answered. The throbbing and whirring
grew fainter, and the shape passed out of sight.
From the tent could be heard the howling of Long
Gun, as he prayed in his own tongue.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_217" href="#Page_217"><span title="217">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Quit that!” yelled Bony from the canvas shelter.
“Do you want to frighten us all to death?”</p>

<p>Then Long Gun’s cries were muffled, and it was
evident that he had hidden his head under his
blankets.</p>

<p>“This settles it!” declared Jack positively.
“We’ll make another trip over the mountain to-morrow
and see if we can’t solve this.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we will!” added Nat. “First
thing you know we’ll wake up some night and find
ourselves gone.”</p>

<p>They made preparations to be away all night if
necessary, taking plenty of blankets and food.
Budge and Long Gun decided to remain in camp to
look after things.</p>

<p>“S’posin’youdon’tcomeback?” asked Budge, all
in one word.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll come back,” replied Jack confidently.
“If we don’t, you and Long Gun will have to come
after us.”</p>

<p>“Where’llyoube?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to hunt,” was Jack’s answer as he
flicked his horse with the quirt.</p>

<p>They had decided to do some hunting as they
proceeded, and were on the lookout for game.
The weather continued fine, and the snow had disappeared,
though they might expect heavy storms
almost any day, Long Gun said.</p>

<p>They crossed the mountain ridge, and started<a class="pagenum" id="Page_218" href="#Page_218"><span title="218">&#160;</span></a>
down the other side, without having had a chance
to shoot anything. They reached the place where
they had seen the mysterious marks in the snow,
and made a careful examination, but could discover
nothing new.</p>

<p>“Well, Jack, which way now?” asked Sam as
they stood looking about them.</p>

<p>“Down the mountain,” decided Jack. “I think
we may get a shot at some deer, if we don’t find
anything else in the valley. Long Gun said it was
a good hunting ground.”</p>

<p>They rode on, Jack and Nat in advance.
Whether their horses were better than the steeds
of their companions, or whether Jack and Nat
unconsciously urged them to greater speed, was
not apparent, but the fact was that in about an
hour the two found themselves alone, having distanced
their companions.</p>

<p>“Let’s wait for them,” suggested Nat.</p>

<p>“No, let’s keep on. It’s a good trail, and they
can’t miss it. They’ll catch up to us soon. Maybe
we can see something to shoot if we go on a little
way, or maybe——”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll see that mysterious bird,” finished
Nat. “I believe you’d rather find that than kill a
big buck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Jack slowly. “I’d
like to get a nice buck, but I’d also like to solve that
mystery.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_219" href="#Page_219"><span title="219">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Speaking of bucks,” whispered Nat quickly,
“look there! Two of ’em!”</p>

<p>He pointed to a little glade, into which they
were turning, and Jack saw two large mule deer
feeding on the grass.</p>

<p>“A buck and a doe,” he said as he raised his
rifle. “I think we are close enough to risk a shot.
You take the buck, Nat. You haven’t had a good
pair of horns yet, and that fellow has some beauts.
We’ll both fire together.”</p>

<p>Nat nodded to show that he understood. The
deer had not scented the young hunters, but were
still quietly feeding. Slowly Jack and Nat raised
their rifles, having dismounted from their horses.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to pull the triggers a
curious thing happened. The deer suddenly raised
their heads, and gazed at a spot to the left of
them. Then they bounded away, so swiftly that
it was difficult for the eye to follow them.</p>

<p>“Well, did you see that?” asked Nat. “Something
scared them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it wasn’t us,” said Jack. “We’re
out of sight, and the wind’s blowing from them to
us. I’m going to see what it was that sent them
off.”</p>

<p>He mounted his horse again, an example that
Nat followed, and they rode down the glade to
where the deer had been feeding.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_220" href="#Page_220"><span title="220">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I wonder if it could have been a bear?” asked
Jack of his chum. “If it was——”</p>

<p>He did not get a chance to finish the sentence,
for even as he spoke the bushes just in front of
the two lads were parted, and three men stepped
into view.</p>

<p>“What are you lads doing here?” asked one of
the strangers sternly.</p>

<p>“We—we were hunting,” replied Jack. “We
saw two deer, but they ran before we could get a
shot.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better make back tracks to where
you came from,” said another man gruffly.
“Vamoose, you!”</p>

<p>“Are these private grounds?” asked Jack. “We
didn’t know. We’re camped on the other side of
the mountain, and we understood we could hunt
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t,” said the third man. “These
aren’t private grounds, but we don’t want you
around here, so you’d better skedaddle. Move on,
now, or it won’t be healthy for you.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he advanced his rifle in a threatening
manner.</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t want to trespass,” spoke Nat.
“We’ll go.”</p>

<p>“You’d better,” was the grim response of the
man who had first spoken. “Clear out, and don’t<a class="pagenum" id="Page_221" href="#Page_221"><span title="221">&#160;</span></a>
come here again. We don’t want any spies
around.”</p>

<p>“We’re not spies,” said Jack, wondering that
the man should use such a term.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t care what you are. Clear out!
That’s all! Clear out!”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but turn back. Slowly
Jack and Nat wheeled their horses, meanwhile
narrowly eyeing the men. The trio, though roughly
dressed, did not appear like hard characters or
desperadoes. They looked like miners.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to move faster than that,” said the
man who had spoken first. “If you don’t we may
have to make you.”</p>

<p>There was a movement in the bushes back of
him, and Jack and Nat glanced in that direction to
see who was coming. Another figure stepped into
view, the figure of a lad well known to Jack and
Nat, for it was none other than Jerry Chowden,
the former bully of Washington Hall.</p>

<p>“Jerry Chowden!” gasped Jack.</p>

<p>“Jack—Jack Ranger!” exclaimed the bully, no
less surprised than were the two lads on horses.</p>

<p>“Do you know him?” asked one of the men
quickly of Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes—er—that is——”</p>

<p>“Come on, you! Move away from here if you
don’t want to get into trouble!” fairly shouted one
of the men. He advanced toward Jack and Nat,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_222" href="#Page_222"><span title="222">&#160;</span></a>
who, deeming discretion the better part of valor,
clapped spurs to their horses, and raced along the
trail to rejoin their companions. As they galloped
on Jack gave one glance over his shoulder. He
saw Jerry Chowden in earnest conversation with
the three men, and that our hero and Nat was the
subject of the talk was evident from the manner
in which the bully was pointing toward them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_223" href="#Page_223"><span title="223">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>WILL SAVES JACK’S LIFE</small></h2>


<p>“What do you think of that, Jack?” asked
Nat. “Bullyragging bean-poles! but who would
have expected to meet Jerry Chowden out here?
What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Jack replied. “I’m as much
surprised as you are. Not only at seeing him, but
at meeting those men, and at being ordered back.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Jerry had anything to do with
them making us move away?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean do you think he told those men lies
about us? Such as saying we were dangerous characters,
and not safe to have around?”</p>

<p>“No, I hardly think that. I believe those men
have something to conceal, and would order back
any one who they thought would discover their
secret. They ordered us back before Jerry appeared
and recognized us.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. But how do you suppose he came
to get in with them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It’s all part of the same puzzle,
I think—the mysterious sounds, the queer<a class="pagenum" id="Page_224" href="#Page_224"><span title="224">&#160;</span></a>
marks in the snow, and all that. Of course, Jerry
may have met them by accident, and they might
have hired him. We knew he came out West,
you know, after the part he played in kidnapping
us, and very likely he was willing to do any kind
of rascally work these men wanted.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s probable. But what do you s’pose
it is?”</p>

<p>“I give it up; that is, for the time being. But
I’m going to solve this mystery, Nat, if it takes
all winter. We’ve got something to do now besides
hunt. We’ll see what these men are up to.
Maybe it’s something criminal, such as Jonas
Lavine and his gang were mixed up in.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think that.”</p>

<p>“What do you think, then?”</p>

<p>“I believe they have some rare kind of animal
or bird, or, maybe, several of them, and they are
going to place them on exhibition. For I’m sure
the noise we heard, and the marks in the snow,
were made by some gigantic bird.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re away off,” declared Jack. “It isn’t
possible.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. ’Most anything is possible
nowadays,” answered Nat.</p>

<p>They soon rejoined their comrades, and told
them what had happened. Sam was for going on,
defying the men, and administering a sound drubbing
to Jerry.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_225" href="#Page_225"><span title="225">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Then we’ll find out what’s up,” he said, “and
end all this suspense.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and maybe get into trouble,” objected
Jack. “There must be several men in that camp,
if it was a camp, and those we saw seemed ready
to use their guns on us. No, I think we’ll have to
prospect around a bit first, until we see how the
land lays. I’m not going to run into danger. We
made a mistake by moving too suddenly in the
bogus stock certificate case, and only because of
good luck were the rascals caught. I’m going a
little slower this time.”</p>

<p>“Jerry Chowden is certainly going to the bad
fast,” declared Bony.</p>

<p>“We don’t know that he is in anything bad
this time,” said Jack. “It may be all right, and
those men may be engaged in some regular business.
But I admit it looks suspicious.”</p>

<p>A sharp snowstorm kept the boys in camp the
next two days, but on the third, as fresh meat was
getting low, they started off again after game,
leaving Budge and Long Gun, as usual, in charge
of the place.</p>

<p>“Boys, we’ve got to get something this time,”
said Jack. “The place is like Mother Hubbard’s
cupboard, almost bare, so don’t despise even jack-rabbits,
though, of course, a nice deer or a sheep
would go better.”</p>

<p>They had been directed by Long Gun to take a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_226" href="#Page_226"><span title="226">&#160;</span></a>
trail that led obliquely up the side of the mountain,
as the Indian said it was a likely place for game,
and at noon they camped in a little clearing for
lunch, having had no sight of anything bigger
than squirrels, which they would not shoot.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is,” said Jack, after thinking
the matter over, “I believe we’re too closely
bunched. We ought to divide up, some go one
way, and some the other. We’d be more likely
to see something then. We can make a circle, and
work our way around back to camp by nightfall.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sam. “Bony and I will take
the trail to the left, and you can go to the right
with Nat and Will. I’ll wager we beat you, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s a go,” agreed Jack. “Come on.”</p>

<p>A little later the two parties of young hunters
separated, and were soon lost to sight of each
other.</p>

<p>For an hour or more Jack, Nat and Will slowly
urged their horses through the light snow. They
kept a sharp lookout for signs of game, but were
beginning to despair of seeing any, when Jack uttered
a cry.</p>

<p>“There’s been a deer along here,” he said. “And
not long ago, either, if I’m any judge of the signs
Long Gun taught us.”</p>

<p>“It does look so,” admitted Nat. “Easy, now,
and maybe we can trail him.”</p>

<p>“We’d better leave our horses, though,” Jack<a class="pagenum" id="Page_227" href="#Page_227"><span title="227">&#160;</span></a>
went on. “It’s bad going, and they make quite
a bit of noise.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay with them,” volunteered Nat. “I’ve
had my share of good shots lately. Let Will have
a show. You and he go ahead, Jack.”</p>

<p>Jack did not want to leave Nat, but his chum
insisted that some one had to stay with the animals,
and he wanted to do it. So Will and Jack started
off alone to trail the deer.</p>

<p>They went on about a mile, the trail becoming
fresher at every step, until Will, who was close
behind Jack, gently touched his companion on the
arm and pointed to the left.</p>

<p>There, framed in a little opening of the trees,
pawing the snow off the grass in a little glade,
stood a noble buck mule deer, the largest Jack had
ever seen. The animal had not heard nor scented
them.</p>

<p>“Take the shot, Will,” urged Jack. “You may
never get another like that.”</p>

<p>“No, I’d rather you would.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. I’ve shot several of ’em. You
take it.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you would.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” urged Jack in a whisper. “Wait,
though, we’ll move forward a bit, and you work
off to the left. You’ll get a better shot then. The
wind’s just right.”</p>

<p>They went forward a few feet cautiously, until<a class="pagenum" id="Page_228" href="#Page_228"><span title="228">&#160;</span></a>
they stood just on the edge of the clearing. Then
Will, stepping a few paces to the left, raised his
rifle. No sooner had he done so than, to his surprise
and regret, his arms began to shake violently.
He had a severe touch of “buck fever.”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t do it. I’m too nervous,” he said in
a whisper to Jack.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Wait a minute and aim again.
You’ll be all right in a second. Take a long breath
and count five.”</p>

<p>Will did as directed, but it was no use. The
muzzle of his rifle wobbled more than ever when
he tried to aim.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t,” he whispered again. “You shoot,
Jack.”</p>

<p>Then, realizing that Will was too nervous to
do it, and not wanting to see the buck escape, as
they needed fresh meat in camp, Jack took aim and
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>At the instant the report rang out, the buck
raised his head, wheeled around, and catching sight
of Jack standing on the edge of the clearing, came
at him almost as fast as an express train. He had
been only slightly wounded, and, full of rage, he
had only one desire—to annihilate the person responsible
for the stinging pain he felt.</p>

<p>Jack saw him coming, and threw down the lever
of his rifle to pump another cartridge into the
chamber. But, to his horror, the lever refused to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_229" href="#Page_229"><span title="229">&#160;</span></a>
work. It had become jammed in some way, and
the exploded shell could not be ejected. He pulled
and tugged at it, the buck coming nearer by leaps
and bounds.</p>

<p>“Jump—jump!” Jack heard Will cry, and
realizing that he could not get in another shot, he
leaped to one side, hoping to get out of the way
of the infuriated animal.</p>

<p>But his foot caught in the entangled branch of
a bush, and he fell backward, full length, right in
the path of the advancing buck, that was snorting
with rage.</p>

<p>Jack tried to roll over, but the bush held him
fast. He felt that it was all up with him, and he
closed his eyes, expecting the next instant to feel
the buck leap on him, to pierce him with its keen
hoofs.</p>

<p>Jack could hear the thundering approach of
the big creature, and he could feel the tremor of
the ground as the brute came nearer. He fancied
he could see the big bulk in the air over him.</p>

<p>Then there sounded a sharp crack, followed by
a thud, and the black shape seemed to pass to one
side. There was a shock as a big body hit the
ground, a great crashing among the bushes, and
Jack opened his eyes to see the buck lying dead a
few feet away from him.</p>

<p>Then he saw something else. It was Will, running
toward him, a smoking rifle in his hands.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_230" href="#Page_230"><span title="230">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Are you—are you all right?” asked Will, his
voice trembling.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack, hardly able to speak, because
of the reaction of the shock through which he had
just passed. “I’m all right. Did you shoot the
buck?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” replied Will with a nervous
laugh. “I aimed my rifle at him and pulled the
trigger, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Jack went over to the big body, that had not
ceased quivering.</p>

<p>“Right through the heart,” he said, as he saw
where the bullet had gone in. “Bill, you saved my
life!”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_231" href="#Page_231"><span title="231">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>THE BLIZZARD</small></h2>


<p>Jack extended his hand, and clasped that of
Will’s in a firm grip.</p>

<p>“This would have ended my hunting days if
you hadn’t fired,” he said.</p>

<p>“Maybe he would have leaped over you,” said
Will. “He was coming very fast.”</p>

<p>“I saw he was. He’d have jumped right on
me, too, and that would have been the finish of
yours truly. My, but that was a crack shot of
yours.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t seem to take any aim. As soon as I
saw him coming for you, I seemed to get steady all
at once, and I didn’t tremble a bit.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for me you didn’t. My rifle went back
on me just at the wrong minute.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I must take a look. It’s risky
to be hunting with such a rifle.”</p>

<p>Jack looked for the cause of the trouble, and
found that in taking the gun apart to clean it he
had not screwed in far enough a certain bolt, which<a class="pagenum" id="Page_232" href="#Page_232"><span title="232">&#160;</span></a>
projected and prevented the breech mechanism
from working. The trouble was soon remedied,
and the rifle was ready for use again.</p>

<p>“Well, you can shoot the next buck,” remarked
Will as the two looked at the carcass of the big
animal.</p>

<p>“Not to-day. I’d shake worse than you did if
I tried to aim. We’ll do no more hunting to-day.
We’ll go back and get Nat, and take this to camp.
There’s enough for a week.”</p>

<p>It was with no little difficulty that the three
boys loaded the best parts of the buck on their
horses and started back to camp. They found
that Sam and Bony had arrived ahead of them,
Sam having killed a fine ram.</p>

<p>“Well, I know what I’m going to do to-day,”
remarked Jack the next morning.</p>

<p>“What?” inquired Nat.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have another try at that mystery.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’ll be safe?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why. I’m going to try to get to
that camp from another trail, and if they see me
the worst they can do will be to order me away
again.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” declared Nat, and the others
agreed to accompany the senior member of the
gun club.</p>

<p>They started directly after breakfast, Jack, Nat,
Sam, Bony and Will. Jack, making inquiries of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_233" href="#Page_233"><span title="233">&#160;</span></a>
Long Gun, learned of another trail that could be
taken. They rode along this for several miles, and
then proceeded cautiously, as they judged they
were near where the hostile men had their camp.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nat, who was riding along beside Jack,
stopped his horse and began sniffing the air.</p>

<p>“Smell anything?” he asked his chum.</p>

<p>Jack took several long breaths. Then he
nodded.</p>

<p>“Gasolene, eh?” questioned Nat. “Cæsar’s pancakes!
but I believe we’re on the track of those
same bogus certificate printers again!”</p>

<p>“It can’t be,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“But smell the gasolene.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but it might be from an automobile.”</p>

<p>“An automobile out here? Nonsense! Listen,
you can hear the pounding of the engine.”</p>

<p>Certainly there was an odd throbbing noise, but
just as Jack was beginning to locate it again the
sound ceased.</p>

<p>“Never mind, fellows,” he said. “We’ll follow
the smell of the gasolene. I don’t believe it’s the
same gang that we were on the trail of before, but
we’ll soon find out. Keep together, now.”</p>

<p>They went on for perhaps half a mile farther,
when there was a sudden motion among the bushes
on the trail ahead of them, and a man’s voice
called out:</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_234" href="#Page_234"><span title="234">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Halt!”</p>

<p>It was one of the three men who had, a few days
previous, warned Jack and Nat away.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” the man demanded.</p>

<p>“We were looking for your camp,” said Jack
boldly.</p>

<p>“Our camp?”</p>

<p>The man seemed much surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes. We wanted to see what sort of a place
you had. We smelled the gasolene, and heard the
engine, and——”</p>

<p>“Now look here!” exclaimed the man angrily.
“You’ve been told once to keep away from here,
and this is the second time. The next time you
won’t hear us tell you. We’ll shoot without warning.
And we won’t shoot you, either, for we
think you’re here more out of curiosity than anything
else, but we’ll shoot your horses, and you
know what it means to be without a horse out here.
So if you know what’s good for you, keep away.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added another voice. “You’d better
keep away from here, Jack Ranger, if you don’t
want to get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it, Jerry Chowden?” spoke our
hero. “I wonder if your new friends know as
much about you as we do?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind!” exclaimed Jerry quickly.
“You mind your own business, and let me alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve often wished you to do for<a class="pagenum" id="Page_235" href="#Page_235"><span title="235">&#160;</span></a>
me,” spoke Jack. “Do you know that there is a
warrant out for your arrest if you ever come back
in the neighborhood of Denton?”</p>

<p>Jerry gave a frightened look over his shoulder.
The man who had halted the lads had stepped
back into the bushes.</p>

<p>“You clear out of here, Jack Ranger. And you,
too, Nat Anderson and the rest of the bunch!”
snapped Jerry, and then he drew from his pocket
a revolver.</p>

<p>“Look out, Jerry, that might go off,” remarked
Jack with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t you make fun of me!” ordered the bully.
“I’m working here, and I’ve got authority to order
you away.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Jerry, tell ’em to vamoose,” added
the man who had first spoken, as he again came
into view. “We don’t want any spies around
here.”</p>

<p>Another man joined the first, and the two looked
angrily at the intruders. They were armed with
shotguns.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked the second man.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Nat lightly, “we just came to call
on an acquaintance of ours—Jerry Chowden. The
police back East would like to see him, and we’ve
just told him.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so!” cried Jerry angrily.</p>

<p>“You’re afraid to go back,” added Jack.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_236" href="#Page_236"><span title="236">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I am not! You mind your own business and
clear out!”</p>

<p>“Yes, move on,” ordered the first man, but Jack
noted that he looked closely at Jerry, as if to determine
the effect of the charges made against the
bully.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing else to do, and the
boys turned back.</p>

<p>“Beaten again,” remarked Jack, as they headed
for camp. “Well, there’s just one other way of
discovering their secret.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Go down the mountain, directly back of their
camp, only it’s dangerous because it’s so steep. We
can’t take the horses. I’ll try that way, however,
before I’ll let Jerry Chowden laugh at us.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” answered Nat, and Sam and Bony
said the same thing.</p>

<p>“I think we’re in for a storm,” remarked Will
as they jogged along. “It’s beginning to snow.”</p>

<p>A few flakes were sifting lazily down, and they
increased by the time the boys reached camp,
where they found Budge and Long Gun busy tightening
the tent ropes and piling the wood and provisions
within the smaller supply tent.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Storm comin’,” replied the Indian. “Plenty
much bad. Git ready.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning Jack and his chums were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_237" href="#Page_237"><span title="237">&#160;</span></a>
awakened by the wind howling about their tent.
It was cold, in spite of heavy blankets and thick
clothing.</p>

<p>“B-r-r-r!” exclaimed Jack as he crawled out and
went to the flap of the tent. Then he gave a
startled cry.</p>

<p>“Boys, it’s a regular blizzard!” he said.</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen but a white wall of fiercely
swirling snowflakes, while the wind was howling
through the trees, threatening every minute to
collapse the tent. But Long Gun had done his
work well, and the canvas shelter stood.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_238" href="#Page_238"><span title="238">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>JACK’S HAZARDOUS PLAN</small></h2>


<p>The boys crowded up around Jack and peered
through an opening in the tent flap.</p>

<p>“Blizzard! I should say so!” exclaimed Nat.
“It’s fierce! How are we going to cook any breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Me show,” answered Long Gun with a grin.
Then he pointed to where he and Budge, the day
before, had constructed, inside the living tent, a
small fireplace of stones and earth. There was a
piece of pipe that extended outside the canvas wall,
and in the improvised stove a blaze was soon
started, over which coffee was made, and some
bacon fried.</p>

<p>“Let’s go out and see what it’s like,” proposed
Sam, as he wrapped himself up warmly.</p>

<p>“No go far,” cautioned Long Gun. “No git
back if yo’ do. Heap bad storm.”</p>

<p>“There’s no danger of Sam going too far,” said
Jack. “He’s too fond of the warm stove.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” replied Sam. “I can stand as much
cold as you can.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_239" href="#Page_239"><span title="239">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>But none of the boys cared to be long in that
biting cold, for the wind sent the snowflakes into
their faces with stinging force, and the white crystals
came down so thickly that had they gone far
from the tent it is doubtful if they could have
found their way back again.</p>

<p>The horses were sheltered in a shack that had
been built of saplings, with leaves and earth banked
around it and on the roof, and the animals, huddled
closely together, were warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>Inside the big tent, where the members of the
gun club stayed, it was not cold, for Long Gun
and Budge kept the fire going in the stone stove,
and as the tent was well banked around the bottom,
but little of the biting wind entered.</p>

<p>Nothing could be done, as it was not safe to
venture out, so the boys put in the day cleaning
their guns, polishing some of the horn trophies
they had secured, and talking of what had happened
so far on their camping trip.</p>

<p>Toward evening Long Gun went out to the supply
tent to get some meat to cook. He came back
in a hurry, his face showing much surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jack quickly.</p>

<p>“Meat gone!” exclaimed the Indian. “Something
take him from tent.”</p>

<p>The boys rushed out into the storm toward the
smaller canvas shelter where their food and supplies<a class="pagenum" id="Page_240" href="#Page_240"><span title="240">&#160;</span></a>
were kept. One side had been torn down,
and within there was a scene of confusion.</p>

<p>In the fierceness of the storm, while the campers
had been in the big tent, some wild beast, or, perhaps,
several of them, had stolen up and carried
away most of the food on which Jack and his
chums depended. Nor could it be said what beasts
had robbed them, for their tracks were obliterated
by the snow that had fallen since.</p>

<p>“Well, this is tough luck!” exclaimed Jack.
“What are we going to do now?”</p>

<p>“There’s some bacon left from breakfast,” said
Budge. “Have to eat that, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and, thank goodness, the thieves didn’t
care for coffee,” added Nat. “We sha’n’t starve,
at least, to-night.”</p>

<p>“There’s some canned stuff left, too,” went on
Will.</p>

<p>“But it won’t last long, if this storm keeps up,”
spoke Jack seriously. “I guess we’re going to be
up against it, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Like fish?” asked Long Gun suddenly.</p>

<p>“What have fish got to do with it?” inquired
Bony.</p>

<p>“Catch fish through ice soon. Storm stop,” replied
the Indian. “River plenty full fish.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” commented Jack. “But
when will the blizzard stop?”</p>

<p>It kept up all that night and part of the next<a class="pagenum" id="Page_241" href="#Page_241"><span title="241">&#160;</span></a>
day. The campers were on short rations, as regards
meat, though there was plenty of canned
baked beans, and enough hardtack for some time
yet, while there was flour that could be made into
biscuits. But they needed meat, or something like
it, in that cold climate.</p>

<p>It was late the next afternoon when Jack, looking
from the tent, announced:</p>

<p>“Hurrah, fellows! It’s stopped snowing, and
the wind has gone down. Now for some fish
through the ice. Long Gun, come on and show
us how.”</p>

<p>The Indian got some lines and hooks ready,
using salt pork for bait. Then the whole party
went down to the river, traveling on snowshoes,
for there was a great depth to the snow, and it was
quite soft.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to scrape away the white
blanket and get down to the ice that covered the
river, but they managed it. Holes were chopped
in the frozen surface of the stream, and then they
all began to fish. They had good luck, and soon
had caught enough of the finny residents of the
Shoshone to make a good meal.</p>

<p>“Um-um!” exclaimed Bony, as they sat down
to supper a little later. “Maybe this doesn’t taste
fine!” and he extended his plate for some more
of the fish, fried brown in corn meal, with bacon
as a flavoring.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_242" href="#Page_242"><span title="242">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>The next day Jack, Nat and Sam went out and
killed some jack-rabbits, and this served them until
two days later, when Jack killed a fat ram and
Will a small deer.</p>

<p>All danger of a short food supply was thus obviated,
and, the damaged tent having been repaired,
the boys prepared to resume their hunt.</p>

<p>“We’ve only about three weeks more,” announced
Jack one night. “If we stay much longer
we may get snowed in and have to stay until
spring.”</p>

<p>“Well, that wouldn’t be so bad,” spoke Bony.</p>

<p>“I know why Jack <del class="correction">want’s</del><ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has “want’s”">wants</ins> to start
back,” spoke Sam. “He is going to stop at Pryor’s Gap and see a certain party
with brown eyes, who——”</p>

<p>Then Sam dodged to avoid the snowshoe which
his chum threw across the tent at him.</p>

<p>“When are we going to make another try to
discover the secret of the strange camp?” asked
Nat when quiet was restored.</p>

<p>“That’s so. When?” asked Will. “We haven’t
heard that queer noise lately.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see what we can do to-morrow,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p>That night the lads were startled by again hearing
that strange sound in the air over their camp.
But this time it seemed farther away, and only
lasted a short time, while Jack, who rushed out
the moment he heard it, could discover nothing.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_243" href="#Page_243"><span title="243">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>Jack, Nat, Sam, Bony and Will started off early
the next morning on snowshoes for the top of the
mountain, in accordance with a plan Jack had
formed of trying to reach the camp of the men
from a point directly back of the place whence they
had been ordered away.</p>

<p>They reached the summit of the mountain and
found, as Long Gun had said they would, a trail
leading directly down. But it was so steep and so
covered with snow that it seemed risky to attempt
it.</p>

<p>“We can never get down there,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Sure we can,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“We might if we had some of those long, wooden
snowshoes, like barrel-staves, which the Norwegians
use,” spoke Sam. “Otherwise I don’t see
how we’re going to do it.”</p>

<p>Jack did not reply. Instead he was walking
slowly along what seemed to be an abandoned
trail. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Bony.</p>

<p>“That old sled,” answered Jack, pointing to a
sort of bobsled, that had evidently been made by
lumbermen. It consisted of a platform of slabs,
on long, broad, wooden runners, and stood near
an abandoned camp.</p>

<p>“How can we use that?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Get on it and slide down the mountain,” daringly<a class="pagenum" id="Page_244" href="#Page_244"><span title="244">&#160;</span></a>
proposed Jack. “There’s plenty of snow.
The old sled will hold us all, and maybe we can
ride right into their camp lickity-split. Then they
can’t put us out until we’ve seen what’s going on.
Will you go?”</p>

<p>The boys hesitated a moment. It was a hazardous
plan, one fraught with danger, but they
were not the lads to draw back for that. It seemed
the only feasible way of getting down the mountain.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_245" href="#Page_245"><span title="245">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<small>A PERILOUS RIDE</small></h2>


<p>“Well,” asked Jack again, “will you go, or do
I have to take the trip alone?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” cried Nat suddenly.</p>

<p>“And I!” “And I!” “And I!” added Bony,
Sam and Will.</p>

<p>“Then let’s get the sled out and look it over,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>The old sled seemed to be in fairly good condition.
It was roughly but strongly made, as it had
to be to stand dragging over the mountain trails.
The boys hauled it to the edge of the slope.</p>

<p>“Get on,” called Jack as he began piling upon
the flat top his gun and a package of food he
had brought along.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” proposed Nat.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” inquired Jack.
“You’re not going to back out, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, but it just occurred to me that we’d better
have some sort of a brake on this thing. If we
get going down that mountain we might not be
able to stop.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_246" href="#Page_246"><span title="246">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“We don’t want to, until we get to the camp.”</p>

<p>“But s’pose we get to a ravine, or something
like that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it would be better to have a
brake or drag,” admitted Jack. “I’ll tell you
how we can make one. Get a long sapling, sharpen
one end, and put it down through a hole in the
back of the sled. When you want to stop, just
jab it into the ground, and it will scrape along.”</p>

<p>“Better have two, while you’re at it,” said Sam.
“Then we can steer with them by jabbing first one,
then the other down. They will slew us around
whichever way we want to go.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Jack, always willing to give any
of his chums the credit for a good invention.
“We’ll do it.”</p>

<p>With a small hatchet, which they had brought
with them, two stout saplings were cut, trimmed
of their branches and sharpened to points. Then
they were thrust down holes in the rear of the
sled, near where the wooden runners came to an
end.</p>

<p>“Now I guess we’re all ready,” remarked Jack
as he surveyed the work. “Get aboard, fellows,
for the Snow Sled Limited. No stops this side of
Chicago.”</p>

<p>“And maybe not there, if we get going too fast,”
spoke Bony grimly.</p>

<p>They had taken off their snowshoes, and piled<a class="pagenum" id="Page_247" href="#Page_247"><span title="247">&#160;</span></a>
them on the bob, with their guns and packages of
food. Then the boys took their places.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Jack as he took his seat in
front.</p>

<p>“As ready as we ever shall be,” replied Will,
who was a trifle nervous.</p>

<p>“Then push off, Sam,” called Jack, for Sam
and Nat had taken their places at the two brake
poles. They used them to shove the sled nearer the
edge of the hill, and then, as the sled began to
move, they slipped the sharpened saplings into the
holes again.</p>

<p>Slowly the sled began to go down the hill. At
first the slope was gradual, and the speed was
not great. Then, as the side of the mountain became
more steep, the bob gathered headway, until
it was moving along swiftly.</p>

<p>“Hold on, everybody!” cried Jack. “There’s
a bump just ahead of us!”</p>

<p>The warning came only just in time, for the sled
reached a sort of ridge in the slope, and bounded
up in the air. The boys went with it, and as they
stayed up a little longer than the sled did, when
they came down they did so with considerable
force, so that the breath was nearly shaken out of
them.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” cried Nat. “I bit my tongue.”</p>

<p>“Lucky it’s no worse,” spoke Jack. “Did we
lose anything off the sled, Will?”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_248" href="#Page_248"><span title="248">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“No, but your gun came near going,” for the
food and other objects had slid around when the
jolt came. “I held on to them,” went on the
strange lad, who, from the association of Jack and
his chums, was fast losing his odd manner.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea! Well, we certainly are moving
now.”</p>

<p>And indeed they were. The sled was increasing
its speed every moment, and was now whizzing
along over the snow like some racing automobile,
but with none of the noise. The snow, by reason
of thawing and freezing, had acquired a hard,
slippery surface, and the sled, the broad runners
of which did not sink in, was fairly skimming along
over it.</p>

<p>“Try the brakes!” Jack called back to Sam and
Nat. “Let’s see if they work.”</p>

<p>“Put on brakes!” called Nat, giving vent to a
couple of screeches in imitation of a whistle.</p>

<p>“That means let off brakes,” said Sam. “One
whistle is to put ’em on.”</p>

<p>“What’s the odds?” inquired Nat. “Put your
pole down.”</p>

<p>He was already shoving on his, and Sam did
likewise. There was a shower of white flakes behind
the sled as the sharp points of the poles bit
into the snow. There followed a scratching sound,
and two long depressions appeared to mark the
wake of the bob. Then the speed began to slacken.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_249" href="#Page_249"><span title="249">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“They work all right,” Jack announced. “We’ll
try how they steer, now.”</p>

<p>“Off brakes!” shouted Sam, and he and Nat
pulled up the poles.</p>

<p>Once more the sled shot forward, coasting down
the side of the mountain. Bony sat beside Jack, in
front, while Will was in the centre, surrounded by
the guns and packages.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Bony suddenly. “There’s
a bad place just ahead.”</p>

<p>“I see,” remarked Jack. “We must go to one
side of it.”</p>

<p>The place was a little hollow in the face of
the mountain, and if the sled, which was headed
directly for it, dipped down into it, there might
be a serious accident.</p>

<p>“Jab your pole down, Nat!” cried Jack, as he
calculated to which side of the hollow it was best
to pass. “Jab it hard.”</p>

<p>“Hard it is!” repeated Nat, as he bore down on
his pole with all his force.</p>

<p>The result was more than they bargained for.
The sled slewed suddenly around, and only by
clinging desperately to it did the boys manage to
save themselves from being spilled off.</p>

<p>“Let go!” yelled Jack quickly.</p>

<p>“Let go it is!” Nat managed to repeat, as he
pulled up his pole.</p>

<p>The sled slung around straight again, and continued<a class="pagenum" id="Page_250" href="#Page_250"><span title="250">&#160;</span></a>
to slide, but the steering had been successful,
for they passed well to one side of the hole.</p>

<p>“I guess a light jab will be all we’ll need to
change the course of this schooner,” remarked
Bony. “No more of those ‘hard ’a port’ orders,
Jack.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. We had a narrow escape.”</p>

<p>On and on they went, Jack watching carefully
for holes or rocks, that he might call orders to steer
to one side or the other of them. The sled answered
her “helm” readily, and, when there was
need to slacken speed, the same poles served as
brakes.</p>

<p>There was still a long snowy stretch before them,
though they had come a mile or more. It was fully
five miles to the bottom of the slope, where the
valley began and where they knew the mysterious
men were encamped.</p>

<p>The course they were on led almost straight
down, and, by some curious freak of nature, it was
quite like a cleared road down the side of the
mountain. There were few trees in the path the
sled was taking, and it seemed as if, in ages gone
by, a great snowslide or avalanche had gone crashing
down the declivity, preparing a path upon
which, however, few would have ventured.</p>

<p>Now the speed, which had slackened on a place
where the slope was not so great, became faster.
The wind whistled in the ears of the boys, and the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_251" href="#Page_251"><span title="251">&#160;</span></a>
broad runners were throwing up a fine shower of
frozen snow.</p>

<p>Faster and faster the bob went. It was skimming
along like a great bird now, and the course
was so clear that there was no need of steering.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack spied, just ahead of them, a great
boulder, partly covered with snow. To strike it
meant a disaster, and the sled was headed right for
it.</p>

<p>“Sam! Sam!” cried Jack. “Put your pole
down.”</p>

<p>This would slew the sled to one side. Sam,
bearing in mind what had happened when Nat put
his sapling down too suddenly, gently dug his point
into the snow. But, so great was the speed, that
the sled was slewed around almost as badly as before.</p>

<p>But it cleared the rock, and then righted itself.</p>

<p>“Say, but we’re going some,” remarked Bony.</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“Too fast,” he called. “Put on the brakes, fellows.”</p>

<p>Nat and Sam prepared to obey this order. They
bore down on the saplings, but the sled seemed
only to go the faster.</p>

<p>“Put on brakes! Hard!” yelled Jack.</p>

<p>“We’re trying to,” called Sam.</p>

<p>He and Nat bore down with all their force.
They could hear the ends of the saplings scraping<a class="pagenum" id="Page_252" href="#Page_252"><span title="252">&#160;</span></a>
over the frozen snow, but they did not seem to take
hold. There was no shower of frozen crystals—no
depressions behind the runners.</p>

<div class="center">
    <a id="illus04"></a>
    <img src="images/illus04.jpg"
            alt=""
            title="“THE SLED WENT FASTER AND FASTER.” Transcriber’s Note: moved from next page." />
    <p class="caption">“THE SLED WENT FASTER AND FASTER.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sled went faster and faster. Then Nat understood.</p>

<p>“The points of the brakes are worn off!” he
cried. “They won’t take hold!”</p>

<p>“Take ’em up and sharpen ’em!” shouted Jack.
“We’ve got to slacken up or we’ll be hurt! Sharpen
the stakes.”</p>

<p>It was the only thing to do. The points of the
poles, dragging over the hard snow, had been worn
flat and smooth. It was hard work, putting points
on them, aboard the swaying bob, but Sam and
Nat, aided by Bony and Will, managed to do it
with the hatchet. All the while the sled was skimming
along, faster and faster.</p>

<p>“Jab ’em in! Jab ’em in!” yelled Jack desperately.</p>

<p>Nat and Sam did so. There was a scraping
sound, as the sharp points bit into the snow, but
the speed of the sled did not seem to slacken.</p>

<p>“The snow’s frozen too hard!” cried Nat. “We
can’t stop it now!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to!” yelled Jack. “We’re going
like greased lightning!”</p>

<p>But, try as Nat and Sam did, they could not
force the newly-sharpened stakes into the ground.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_253" href="#Page_253"><span title="253">&#160;</span></a>
Jack, Bony and Will added their strength, but it
was of no use.</p>

<p>Faster and faster the sled leaped down the slope.
The wind cut the faces of the boys, and the flying
particles of snow, freed by the edges of the runners,
stung them like needles.</p>

<p>“We can’t stop!” said Nat, hopelessly.</p>

<p>Straight as an arrow flew the sled.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Will, and he pointed
ahead.</p>

<p>There, right in the path, and not a quarter of
a mile away, at the foot of the hill down which
they were shooting like a rocket, was a patch of
blackness.</p>

<p>“It’s a lake! A lake of open water!” cried
Jack. “Get ready to jump!”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_254" href="#Page_254"><span title="254">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<small>INTO A STRANGE CAMP</small></h2>


<p>It seemed that this was the only thing to do.
To remain on the sled, as it plunged into the black
water, might mean that they would be drawn down
into the depths, never to come up. So the lads
prepared to leap from the swiftly-moving sled.</p>

<p>Yet they would not jump without their guns, and
they hesitated a moment while they secured them.
Then they moved to the edge of the bob.</p>

<p>But to leap from it, while it was traveling almost
with the speed of a railroad train, meant no little
risk. No wonder they hesitated, especially as there
was no place to land but on the hard, frozen surface
of the snow, down which they were sliding.</p>

<p>Still, it was a choice of two desperate expedients,
and, as they supposed, they were choosing the lesser
evil.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” cried Nat, as he crouched for a
spring.</p>

<p>“No! Wait! Wait!” almost screamed Jack.
“That’s not water! It’s ice! It’s ice! We’re all
right! Stay on!”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_255" href="#Page_255"><span title="255">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>He had called only just in time, for, as the sled
came nearer to the black patch, he had seen, from
the glint of light upon its surface, that it was hard,
black, thick ice.</p>

<p>A moment later the sled, striking a little hollow
place bounded into the air. It came down with a
thump, and in another second was skimming over
the frozen surface of a little pond. Straight across
it flew, into a snow bank on the other side, where
it came to an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>So sudden, in fact, was the halting, that Will,
who was near the front end, was shot from the
bob, and came down in the bank of snow, head
first.</p>

<p>“Pull him out!” cried Jack, as he leaped off.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s hurt.”</p>

<p>The others hastened to the aid of their chum,
and he was soon hauled out. He seemed dazed,
and there was blood coming from a cut on his
head.</p>

<p>“Hurt much?” asked Jack anxiously.</p>

<p>“No—not much—hit my head on a stone under
that pile of snow, I guess. But where are we?”</p>

<p>“Where we started for, I think,” replied Jack.
“My, but that was a trip!”</p>

<p>“Petrified pole-cats! I should say so!” ejaculated
Nat. “I thought we were goners!”</p>

<p>“Same here,” remarked Sam. “But we don’t
seem to have arrived at any place.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_256" href="#Page_256"><span title="256">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“We’re at the foot of the hill,” spoke Bony.
“That’s something,” and he tried to crack his
knuckle joints, forgetting that he had thick mittens
on.</p>

<p>“Let’s see what’s beyond those trees,” proposed
Jack, after they had rested, and he pointed to some
dark pines that fringed one shore of the pond.
“Bring your guns, fellows, and come on.”</p>

<p>“What about the grub?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Leave it on the sled,” replied Jack. “We’ll
probably come back here.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the trees, and passed beyond
the natural screen they formed, followed by his
chums. No sooner had he penetrated the thick
branches, than he uttered a cry of surprise. And
well he might.</p>

<p>For in front of the young hunters was a strange
camp, a large one, consisting of a big shed-like
structure, with several small log cabins grouped
around it. And the place smelled of gasolene,
while from one of the cabins came a noise of
machinery in operation.</p>

<p>“Boys!” exclaimed Jack, “we’ve found the
place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there doesn’t seem to be anybody here
to stop us,” remarked Nat.</p>

<p>They stood for a few moments on the edge of
the camp, the secret of which they had tried to
solve several times before.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_257" href="#Page_257"><span title="257">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Come on,” said Jack. “Might as well take it
all in.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the doors of the big shed swung
slowly open. The boys saw a man pushing the
portals, but something else they saw attracted their
attention, and held them spellbound.</p>

<p>For the “something” was a great bird-like creature
in the shed, a creature with an immense spread
of wings, and from the big structure there came a
peculiar throbbing noise, such as that they had
heard in the air over their camp several nights.</p>

<p>“There it is!” exclaimed Nat. “There’s the
monster that’s been flying in the air over our heads!
They’ve got it captive, and they’re trying to tame
it!”</p>

<p>The doors opened wider, the man pushing them
with his back to the boys, so that at first he did
not see them.</p>

<p>“Wow! Aunt Jerusha’s Johnnie cake!” exclaimed
Nat. “See that bird.”</p>

<p>Inside the shed the great creature appeared to be
fluttering its wings.</p>

<p>The boys were peering forward eagerly. Suddenly
there sounded a shout, and from one of the
cabins a figure ran.</p>

<p>“Jerry Chowden!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>Jerry had seen the boys. Pointing one hand at
them, he yelled something to the man opening the
shed doors. In an instant the man turned, went<a class="pagenum" id="Page_258" href="#Page_258"><span title="258">&#160;</span></a>
back into the shed, and the doors swung shut.
Then, from other cabins came several men, running
toward Jack and his chums. Jerry joined
them.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it, now,” remarked Nat.</p>

<p>“Keep cool,” advised Jack. “They can’t hurt us.”</p>

<p>“That’s them! They’re the same fellows!” exclaimed
Jerry, as he ran up.</p>

<p>“Glad to see that you recognize us,” remarked
Jack calmly. “I was afraid you’d forgotten us,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Hu! Think you’re smart, don’t you?” sneered
the former bully of Washington Hall.</p>

<p>“None of this chinning!” exclaimed one of the
men sullenly. “How did you chaps get here, this
time?”</p>

<p>“Slid,” replied Jack laconically.</p>

<p>“Don’t get fresh. It might not be healthy.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” went on Jack. “We slid down
the side of the mountain on a sled, and landed on
your little lake back of the trees.”</p>

<p>“You never did it!” exclaimed the man incredulously.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack slowly, “if you don’t believe
it you can go back there and look at the lake.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Nat, “and if that doesn’t convince
you, you can go look at the mountain, and see the
sled.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_259" href="#Page_259"><span title="259">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>The man turned, and spoke a few words in a
low voice to one of his companions. The latter set
off toward the fringe of trees.</p>

<p>“Now, what did you chaps come here for?”
went on the spokesman.</p>

<p>“To see your big bird fly,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>The man started.</p>

<p>“We haven’t any big bird,” he said.</p>

<p>“Looks mighty like one, in that shed,” went on
Jack.</p>

<p>The man scowled. Then he resumed.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you warned to keep away from here
before? Weren’t you told that your horses would
be shot if you came?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jack, smiling a bit, “but you
see we haven’t any horses with us now.”</p>

<p>“Hu! That’s a mighty poor joke,” sneered the
man.</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of it myself, but it was the
best I could make under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Jack was as cool as a cucumber, while the man
was visibly losing his temper.</p>

<p>“Lock ’em up!” burst out Jerry Chowden.
“That Ranger fellow and Nat Anderson are always
making trouble.”</p>

<p>“Say, when I want your advice I’ll ask for it,”
said the man curtly. Just then the individual he
had sent off to report about the sled came back.</p>

<p>“It’s there,” he said.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_260" href="#Page_260"><span title="260">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Hum!” murmured the other. Then, turning
to the group of men about him he said: “Better
take ’em, and put ’em in one of the vacant cabins
for the time being. Then I’ll decide what to do
with them.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t any right to touch us, or detain
us!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“We haven’t, eh? Well we’re going to take
the right, just the same. You put your head in
the lion’s mouth, and now you are going to be
lucky if he doesn’t bite it off. Lock ’em up, men.”</p>

<p>Several of the roughly-dressed men advanced
toward the group of boys. Jack’s chums looked to
him for advice. He had gotten them into the difficulty,
and it was up to him to get them out.</p>

<p>“See here!” exclaimed our hero boldly. “Don’t
you lay hands on us. We are camping on this
mountain, and I happen to know that it’s government
land, and that any one has a right to travel
all around it. We have just as much right here as
you have, and if you annoy us I’ll appeal to the
law.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no law out here, sonny,” said one
man. “You are suspicious characters, anyhow.
Better not make a fuss now. We’re too many for
you. Next time mind your own affairs and you’ll
not get into trouble.”</p>

<p>The men had seized Nat, Bony, Sam and were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_261" href="#Page_261"><span title="261">&#160;</span></a>
advancing toward Will and Jack, who stood a
little to one side of their chums.</p>

<p>One man laid hold of Jack, and our hero tried to
wrench himself free. But the man was too strong
for him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Will looked across the camp. He saw
the man again coming from the big shed. For a
moment it seemed as if the lad had seen a ghost,
his eyes stared so. Then, with a cry he sprang
forward, and ran toward the person near the big
shed.</p>

<p>“Catch him!” shouted the man who had directed
that the boys be made prisoners. “He’s locoed—crazy!”</p>

<p>“Andy will look after him! He’s running right
into his arms,” said some one, and sure enough,
the man did catch Will in his arms. The next moment
the two disappeared inside the big shed.</p>

<p>Jack and his chums looked at one another.</p>

<p>“He must have gone suddenly out of his head,”
said Jack. “That blow he got when he landed in
the snow bank has crazed him.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_262" href="#Page_262"><span title="262">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<small>HELD CAPTIVES</small></h2>


<p>“Now then, you chaps; are you going to come
along quietly, or will we have to use force?” demanded
the man who had hold of Jack.</p>

<p>“It depends on what you’re going to do with
us,” replied the captain of the gun club.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what we are going to do
with you,” answered the man. “It will depend on
what Andy says.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Andy?”</p>

<p>“That man who just captured your friend—the
lad that tried to get away.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” burst out Nat. “If you hurt Will,
or any of us, we’ll have you arrested. Hoptoads
and hornets! but you haven’t any right to treat
us this way.”</p>

<p>“Say, sonny, don’t use such big words, or you
might break an arm or leg,” spoke the man sarcastically.
“I’ve told you once that you hadn’t any
right to come here, but now that you’re here, you’ll
have to put up with the consequences. You’ll have
to stay here, until Andy decides what to do with
you.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_263" href="#Page_263"><span title="263">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Well, you’d better go ask him to decide at
once,” suggested Sam. “We’ve got a long way to
go back to camp, and we want to start.”</p>

<p>“Now just take your time,” advised the man.
“You’re not running this.”</p>

<p>He took off his cap, and scratched his head in
perplexity. He had a shock of thick, red hair, and
for want of a better name, since he had not announced
it, the lads dubbed him Sandy.</p>

<p>“Was that Andy, as you call him, who went in
the big shed with Will?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s him. He’ll have to decide what to do
with you, for I’m blessed if I know. He’s the
boss.”</p>

<p>“Then go ask him,” demanded Jack, backing up
Sam’s suggestion.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because Andy has given orders that no one but
himself is allowed inside that shed, except on certain
occasions.”</p>

<p>“Is he afraid the big bird will get away?” asked
Nat.</p>

<p>“What big bird?” inquired Sandy quickly. He
took a tighter grip of Jack’s arm, and the other
men in the group, each of whom held one of the
young captives, seemed waiting for Nat’s reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, we know you’ve got some kind of a monster
bird in that shed,” went on Nat. “We heard<a class="pagenum" id="Page_264" href="#Page_264"><span title="264">&#160;</span></a>
it flying over our camp, and we came out here
to see it.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you came for?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” put in Jack. “We wanted to solve
the mystery of the strange noises, and the queer
marks in the snow.”</p>

<p>“What queer marks in the snow?”</p>

<p>Jack told Sandy what he and his chums had seen,
relating in detail how they had tried, on several
occasions, to penetrate to the camp, and how, at
length, they had made the trip on the sled.</p>

<p>“Now why don’t you go tell Andy, who seems
to be the head of this crowd, what I say, and ask
him to let us go?” went on Jack. “We meant no
harm, but we’d like to see the bird.”</p>

<p>“So you think it’s a bird; eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or perhaps some prehistoric monster.”</p>

<p>Sandy laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re right in thinking Andy is the head of
this camp,” he said. “We’re all working for him,
but, as I said, he won’t let one of us go inside that
shed without his orders. Since your friend went
in there he’ll have to stay until Andy brings him
out. Then you can make your own plea. Until
then I’m going——”</p>

<p>“If you’re going to hold us prisoners, you’d better
think twice about it,” went on Jack. “My
father has friends out West here, and I shall telegraph
him of this outrage as soon as I get away.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_265" href="#Page_265"><span title="265">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Now go easy,” advised the red-haired man.
“I’m not going to harm any of you, but I’m not
going to let you get away until Andy has seen you.
You’ll have to stay here, but we’ll make you as
comfortable as possible. I guess you can stay in
one of the cabins. There are some of them empty,
as a number of the men have left.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re captives?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it that,” spoke
Sandy with a grin. “Just consider yourselves our
guests. We’ll treat you well, and give you plenty
of grub, such as it is.”</p>

<p>“We have some of our own,” Bony said.</p>

<p>“You haven’t any right to detain us,” declared
Sam.</p>

<p>“We won’t discuss that again,” said Sandy.
“Now be reasonable. S’pose I did let you go. You
couldn’t get back to your camp to-night, over the
mountain, and without horses. You’d have to
camp in the open. Isn’t it better to stay in one
of our cabins, where it’s nice and warm? Besides,
it looks like a storm.”</p>

<p>Jack could not but admit that this reasoning was
good. They had not counted on getting back, after
their trip on the sled, but it was obvious that they
could not coast back to camp, and if they had started
to return, they would have had to pass the night
in an open camp, no very pleasant prospect.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_266" href="#Page_266"><span title="266">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack at length, “I guess we’ll have
to stay. But I don’t like the idea of being considered
prisoners.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t think of it then,” advised Sandy
with another grin. “Now, you’re free. I let you
go. Where will you head for?”</p>

<p>He released Jack’s arm, and motioned for his
companions to do likewise for the other lads.</p>

<p>Jack looked about him. Clearly there was no
place to escape to. Besides, it would never do to
go off and leave Will in the hands of the enemy.
There was nothing to do but to stay.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” went on Sandy, “you can go to
that cabin over there,” and he pointed to a large
one. “You’ll find some bunks there, a good fireplace,
and some grub. Or you can use your own
provisions, just as you like. All I ask is that you
give me your word of honor that you’ll not leave
without telling me first. It may be that Andy won’t
want you detained at all, but I’m taking no chances.
Will you promise?”</p>

<p>“Will any harm come to Will?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“You mean the lad who ran into the shed? I
can’t say. I know Andy will be very much put
out at his going there, but I don’t believe he’ll harm
him. Now, will you give me your parole, or will
I have to lock you up?”</p>

<p>Jack hesitated a moment.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_267" href="#Page_267"><span title="267">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I haven’t any right to speak for my chums,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Then take a few minutes to talk with them.
We’ll leave you alone for five minutes, and you can
give me your answer then.”</p>

<p>Sandy and his men withdrew a short distance,
leaving the boys in a group by themselves.</p>

<p>“Well?” questioned Jack. “What shall we
do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what we can do but give him our
promise,” replied Sam. “It will be better to be by
ourselves, and comparatively free, than to be locked
up somewhere. Besides, we haven’t discovered the
secret yet.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Nat. “I want to see what’s
in that shed.”</p>

<p>“And we may be better able to help Will, by
being somewhat free,” added Bony. “I’m for
giving our parole.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jack. “I think, myself, that
will be the best plan. I wonder what in the world
can be in that shed?”</p>

<p>“And I wonder what’s happening to Will in
there?” added Nat. “We must find out, if possible.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give our parole,” called Jack to Sandy,
and the red-haired man approached the group of
boys alone, having motioned to his companions, on<a class="pagenum" id="Page_268" href="#Page_268"><span title="268">&#160;</span></a>
hearing this, that they could resume their occupations.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” answered the red-haired man, apparently
much relieved. “Now you can go over
there and make yourselves at home. You say you
have some grub of your own. Fetch it, and get
busy. Nobody will disturb you.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll speak to Andy about us, as soon
as you can; won’t you?” asked Nat.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. You’re only in the way here, if
you’ll excuse my saying so, and the sooner you’re
off, the sooner we can go on with our work.”</p>

<p>The boys went to where they had left the sled,
got the packages of food, and, with their guns,
which had first been taken from them, and then restored,
as they gave their parole, they went to the
cabin Sandy indicated.</p>

<p>The red-haired man seemed to pay no further
attention to them, but entered another cabin, near
the big shed, while none of the other men were now
in sight. Jerry Chowden had also disappeared.</p>

<p>“They’ve left us to ourselves,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Sam. “I wonder what their
‘work’ can be?”</p>

<p>“It’s got something to do with that gigantic bird,
I’m sure,” said Nat. “Queer, though, it doesn’t
make some sound.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s dead,” suggested Bony, absently
cracking his finger knuckles.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_269" href="#Page_269"><span title="269">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“No, for we saw the wings moving when the
doors were open,” said Jack. “They were evidently
just going to let it out, when they saw us.”</p>

<p>“But what puzzles me,” went on Nat, “is why
Will ran off in that queer fashion.”</p>

<p>“And why they’re keeping him in that shed,”
added Bony. “Why don’t they let him come here
with us? We’re all in the same boat, as far as
coming here is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re going to make an example of
him,” suggested Nat.</p>

<p>“An example? What do you mean?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, you know they’ve got a terrible big bird,
or some monster in there. Maybe they’re going to
feed Will to it—offer him up as a sort of human
sacrifice, you know. Maybe these men worship
that strange bird.”</p>

<p>“Say, you’ve been reading too many dime
novels,” cried Jack. “Offer Will for a sacrifice!
You’re crazy to think of such a thing, Nat!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. Didn’t the old Aztecs make human
sacrifices?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but these men aren’t Aztecs.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? Of course they aren’t!
They’re Americans, all right.”</p>

<p>“But they’ve got some queer secret in that shed,”
declared Nat obstinately.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_270" href="#Page_270"><span title="270">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“True enough,” admitted Jack, “and we’re going
to discover what it is, if possible. But now
let’s get something to eat. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>They found a good fireplace in the log cabin, and
plenty of dry wood, and soon had a roaring blaze
going. They prepared a simple meal, finding a
sufficient supply of dishes in the place, and after
eating heartily of the food they had brought
along, they felt better. It was getting late in the
afternoon, and they prepared to spend the night
in the hut.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Budge and Long Gun will worry
about our not coming back?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jack, “for I told Budge I didn’t
see how we could return, in case we were successful
in getting to the mysterious camp.”</p>

<p>“Well, we got here all right,” remarked Nat,
with an uneasy laugh. “The question is, how to
get away.”</p>

<p>“And rescue Will,” added Bony.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Jack, “I don’t like the way he
acted. I’m afraid his brain was affected by the
blow on the head, following the fright at coming
down on the sled. He isn’t very strong, and it
wouldn’t take much to upset him. Besides, he’s
been worrying about finding his uncle, and about
the mean way his guardian has treated him. I certainly
hope nothing has happened to him in that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_271" href="#Page_271"><span title="271">&#160;</span></a>
shed, but I can’t understand why that man Andy
should keep him there.”</p>

<p>The boys passed rather an uneasy night, not
only because of their strange surroundings, but on
account of worrying over the fate of Will. Nor
were they altogether easy regarding themselves.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re still alive, at any rate,” observed
Jack, as he arose the next morning, and helped to
get a simple breakfast. “Did any of you fellows
hear anything in the night?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that I heard people sneaking
around the cabin,” said Bony.</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Sam.</p>

<p>“Guess they didn’t altogether trust us,” came
from Nat. “They looked in on us every once in
a while. I wonder how Will slept?”</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to wait to have that answered,”
remarked Jack. “If I see Sandy I’ll ask
him——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and looked from a window.</p>

<p>“Here comes Will now,” he added.</p>

<p>“And that man Andy is with him!” exclaimed
Sam. “Maybe now we’ll solve the mystery.”</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_272" href="#Page_272"><span title="272">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<small>THE MYSTERY EXPLAINED</small></h2>


<p>Jack opened the cabin door, and stood in it,
prepared to greet Will. The other captives gathered
back of their chum.</p>

<p>“How are you, Will?” asked Jack, as soon as his
friend came within speaking distance. “We were
quite worried about you.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” answered the strange lad.</p>

<p>“Why did you run away?” inquired Sam, while
Nat looked closely at Andy. The man had a good-natured,
smiling face, and Nat’s spirits began to
rise. He did not think they had much to fear from
such a man.</p>

<p>“It’s a strange story,” said Will, as he entered
the cabin, followed by the man.</p>

<p>The boys crowded around the two, and waited
anxiously for Will’s next words.</p>

<p>“First,” began the lad, who had acted so strangely,
“let me introduce to you my uncle, Mr.&#160;Andrew
Swaim.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“Your uncle!” echoed Sam, Bony and Nat.</p>

<p>“That’s right. My uncle, whom I ran away<a class="pagenum" id="Page_273" href="#Page_273"><span title="273">&#160;</span></a>
from home to seek,” went on Will. “I never expected
to find him here.”</p>

<p>“Nor I to see my nephew,” explained Mr.&#160;Swaim.
“I was never more surprised in my life than
when he ran to me in the shed. After he had called
me by name, he fainted dead away. He has been unconscious
all night, and only a few minutes ago did
he come to his senses. I remained at his bedside
all the while. As soon as he roused, and felt better,
he told me about coming here with you boys, and
insisted that I come out to look for you. That
was the first I knew you were still in my camp. I
hope you haven’t suffered any inconvenience. I
saw you as I was about to open the shed doors, but
I supposed my men warned you away. I hope you
are not angry.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” replied Jack with a smile. “And
so Will fainted as soon as he greeted you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He explained later that he got a blow on
the head, and that, together with the thrilling ride
down the mountain, on top of the worry he had
sustained in searching for me, and other hardships
he had undergone, made him go temporarily out
of his mind. But he is all right now, he says.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I am,” said Will. “All my
troubles are over, now that I’ve found my uncle.
What did you think, when I ran away?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know what to think,” replied Jack.
“Especially when you didn’t come back.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_274" href="#Page_274"><span title="274">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“This is how it was,” explained Will. “I saw
my uncle as soon as he began opening the big doors
the second time. Before I knew what I was doing
I had run toward him, and when I was near enough
I called his name, and told him who I was. He
recognized me at once, and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I saw that he was about to keel over,”
interrupted Mr.&#160;Swaim. “I caught him in my
arms, carried him inside the shed, and I had my
hands full all night with him. I had given orders
to my men never to enter that shed except on certain
occasions. They did not disobey my instructions
to tell me you boys were still here, and, of
course, Will could tell me nothing until this morning.
Then he insisted that we come out and find
you. I called in Stephen——”</p>

<p>“Is that the red-haired man?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“He is. I called him in, and he explained about
you being in this cabin. And now here we are—Will
and I, and I can’t thank you enough, Jack
Ranger, for what you did for him. He has told
me a little about it, and how kind you were to him
in school. I shall have a score to settle with that
rascally guardian of his. I never suspected Gabel
could be so mean. But his charge of my nephew
is ended. I will make other provisions for Will.
Are you boys all right now? Did you have some
breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Jack. “If we had known that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_275" href="#Page_275"><span title="275">&#160;</span></a>
Will’s uncle was in charge of this camp, we
wouldn’t have——”</p>

<p>“Now don’t make any apologies,” interrupted
Mr.&#160;Swaim. “It’s all right. I want you to make
yourselves right to home here. My regulations
were only intended for men who might try to spy
on my work. For I am perfecting a means——”</p>

<p>“Fellows, you’ll never guess what the mystery
is,” burst out Will. “Excuse me, Uncle Andy,” he
went on, “but let me tell them. You see we’ve puzzled
over it so long, and none of us could guess.
Jack, Nat, Sam, Bony—what do you think it is
that my uncle has in the big shed—the thing that
flew over our camp and scared Long Gun so? See
if you can guess.”</p>

<p>“A great bird—like the roc of the Arabian
Nights,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Some sort of eagle, larger than any ever seen in
these parts,” ventured Sam.</p>

<p>“No, that’s as far off as Nat was.”</p>

<p>“A kite, carrying an engine, working a camera,
for taking moving pictures at night,” was Bony’s
guess.</p>

<p>“No,” said Will. “It’s your turn, Jack.”</p>

<p>Jack thought for a minute. He glanced at the
big shed, and then started, as a sudden idea came
to him.</p>

<p>“A balloon?” he asked.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_276" href="#Page_276"><span title="276">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“No, but you’re nearest to it. Shall I tell them,
Uncle Andy?”</p>

<p>Mr.&#160;Swaim nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s a great aeroplane!” exclaimed Will.</p>

<p>“An aeroplane!” exclaimed all the other lads in
a breath.</p>

<p>“A new form of aeroplane, with propellers built
like the great wings of a bird,” explained Mr.&#160;Swaim.
“It’s an invention of mine, but is not
perfected yet, though it flies fairly well. There are
certain parts, on which I have not yet got my patents,
and that is why I do not admit any of the
men to the shed when the ‘<i>Eagle</i>’ as I call her, is
there. But Will got in before I could stop him,
though I guess he’ll not try to get ahead of his
uncle.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Uncle Andy!”</p>

<p>“And did you fly it over our camp?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I did, and that was the sound you heard. It
makes quite a whirring noise, when the wings are
working fast, and the engine has a peculiar throbbing
sound. I don’t wonder you and the Indian
guide were frightened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Long Gun was more scared than we were,”
explained Nat.</p>

<p>“Probably. You see I only flew it at night, because
I did not want any one to see it.”</p>

<p>“And it really works?” asked Bony.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not as well as I would like it to. I<a class="pagenum" id="Page_277" href="#Page_277"><span title="277">&#160;</span></a>
have only been able to take up myself and one other
man, so far. I want it to carry at least five passengers,
but I shall have to alter my engine, or
change the shape of the wings, or else increase their
size, before it will lift that much. But Stephen and
I often flew over the mountain. We used to judge
of our position by your camp-fire. At least I suppose,
from what Will tells me, that it was your
fire.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack. “We heard you calling to one
another one night, and that kept us guessing more
than ever.”</p>

<p>“What about those queer marks in the snow?”
asked Bony.</p>

<p>Mr.&#160;Swaim looked puzzled until Jack explained.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the inventor, “that was when we had
an accident. The <i>Eagle</i> came down unexpectedly,
and turned turtle. Neither I nor Stephen was hurt,
but we had quite a time righting the machine. The
marks you saw must have been the impressions of
the wings in the snow.”</p>

<p>“We thought it was a great bird,” explained
Nat.</p>

<p>“And I wasn’t so far out, calling it an eagle,”
spoke Bony, cracking a couple of finger knuckles,
and ending up with both thumbs.</p>

<p>“I have been out here in this secluded place for
several months,” went on Mr.&#160;Swaim. “That is
why I left no address for my nephew’s guardian, as<a class="pagenum" id="Page_278" href="#Page_278"><span title="278">&#160;</span></a>
I did not want to be disturbed. I never supposed
my nephew would try to find me, and he probably
would not have done so, except by accident. But I
will soon go back East, for my invention is almost
perfected, and I want to give some exhibitions, and
try for some government prizes. Would you boys
like to see it tried?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” exclaimed Jack fervently, and the
others nodded assent.</p>

<p>“We were going to give it a trial when you boys
arrived here,” went on Mr.&#160;Swaim. “Now that
Will is all right, I think I will take the <i>Eagle</i> out
for a flight. I was considerably worried,” he continued,
“when my men brought me reports of
strangers trying to enter the camp, and I gave
strict orders to keep them out. That is why my
men were rather brusk with you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Jack. “We had
no right to come around, but we were very curious.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you. Well, I’ll go and get the
machine ready for a trial spin.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me for mentioning it,” said Jack, as
Mr.&#160;Swaim prepared to leave the cabin, “but you
have a chap here named Jerry Chowden? My
friends and I used to know him.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Mr.&#160;Swaim in some surprise.
“I know little about him. He came to me one day,
and asked for work, saying he needed money. As<a class="pagenum" id="Page_279" href="#Page_279"><span title="279">&#160;</span></a>
I was short of help I took him on, but I am sorry
I did so, for my foreman tells me he is not worth
his salt, and is lazy in the bargain. He never said
anything to me about meeting you. I shall get rid
of him, I think. Is he a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess not!” exclaimed Jack heartily.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it, for I don’t like his manners.
Now I’ll go and see about taking the ship out. Will
may remain with you.”</p>

<p>The boys had plenty to talk about now. Their
exchange of experiences of the incidents of the last
few hours was interrupted by the appearance of
the great aeroplane, as the men wheeled it out of
the shed.</p>

<p>“Wow! Petrified pancakes!” exclaimed Nat.
“That’s a dandy, though!”</p>

<p>Indeed the <i>Eagle</i>, in spite of the fact that Mr.&#160;Swaim
had said it was not completed, was a fine
example of an aeroplane. The boys crowded up
close to it, examining the different parts, while
Will’s uncle and some of his men got it ready for
a flight. As they started the motor, which worked
the great wings, Nat said:</p>

<p>“That accounts for the gasolene smell. I guess
the mystery is all explained now.”</p>

<p>“It seems so,” spoke Jack.</p>

<p>The aeroplane was taken to the ice-covered pond,
over which the sled had slid on the finish of its
perilous trip.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_280" href="#Page_280"><span title="280">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Is that what this is for?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr.&#160;Swaim. “We cleared the
snow off it on purpose to use for our trials. An
aeroplane, you know, as at present constructed, has
to get a start on the ground, in order to acquire
enough momentum to rise. I find it much easier
to skim along on the slippery ice, than over the
ground. Well, are we all ready, Stephen?”</p>

<p>The red-haired man, who was the chief mechanic,
nodded an assent. He and Mr.&#160;Swaim got into
a seat, adjusted some levers and wheels, and then
another man cranked up the motor.</p>

<p>The great propellers, built like the wings of a
bird, began to work, with a sound that was exactly
like that heard over the camp. The aeroplane slid
forward, and after going for some distance over
the frozen pond, rose into the air, as Mr.&#160;Swaim
shifted the elevation rudders.</p>

<p>Up, up, up it went, until it was higher than the
mountain down which the boys had slid. Then
it began to circle about.</p>

<p>“My! But that’s fine!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“Jupiter’s Johnnie cake! But it certainly is!”
exclaimed Nat fervently.</p>

<p>For half an hour or more Mr.&#160;Swaim circled
about in the air overhead; then he and Stephen
came down, landing on the pond with scarcely a
jolt.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_281" href="#Page_281"><span title="281">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” asked the inventor
proudly.</p>

<p>“It’s great!” exclaimed Jack enthusiastically,
and his chums echoed this sentiment.</p>

<p>“Would you like to try a ride in it?” asked
Will’s uncle.</p>

<p>“Well—er—not just now,” stammered Jack,
and Mr.&#160;Swaim laughed.</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t want you to risk it, until I
have perfected it a little more, though Stephen and
I have gone twenty miles in it.”</p>

<p>One of the workmen ran up, and whispered
something to Mr.&#160;Swaim.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” he asked, in some surprise. “Well,
that simplifies matters. I have just been told,” he
went on, turning to the boys, “that Jerry Chowden
has disappeared. I guess he did not want to meet
you lads.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” said Jack significantly.</p>

<p>The boys spent some time further, examining the
aeroplane, and visiting the machine shop, whence
came the throbbing of a gasolene engine—the same
sound they had heard when on their second visit
to the camp.</p>

<p>Jack asked Will’s uncle if on any occasion he and
Stephen had not landed near the camp, for Jack
had in mind the occasion when the meat was stolen
from the tree by the bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, was that your meat?” asked Mr.&#160;Swaim<a class="pagenum" id="Page_282" href="#Page_282"><span title="282">&#160;</span></a>
with a laugh, when Jack had explained. “We always
wondered whom we had robbed. Stephen and
I were out for a flight that night, and we had to
descend because of an accident to the motor. We
came down near the tree where the meat was, and
surprised a bear at work getting it. Bruin scrambled
down and ran away, and we concluded to take
some of the meat, as we were short. Then we
started the machine off again, and came here. I
hope we didn’t put you to any inconvenience.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied Jack. “It only puzzled us
some, that was all. But have you an arrow in
hobnails, on the soles of your boots?”</p>

<p>Mr.&#160;Swaim lifted his foot and showed the arrow.</p>

<p>“That explains everything,” remarked Nat.</p>

<p>“Yes, the mystery is ended,” added Jack.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_283" href="#Page_283"><span title="283">&#160;</span></a></p>




<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<small>JACK MEETS MABEL—CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<p>“Well,” remarked Mr.&#160;Swaim, when the aeroplane
had been put back in the shed, “I’d like to
have you boys come to dinner with me. We don’t
have anything very elaborate in camp——”</p>

<p>“We don’t care for elaborate things,” interrupted
Jack. “We’re camping on our own hook,
and I was just thinking we had better begin to
think of going back, or Budge and Long Gun may
get worried, and start out after us.”</p>

<p>“I’d take you back in the aeroplane, only I can’t
carry you all,” said Mr.&#160;Swaim. “However, let’s
have dinner, and then you can decide what to do.”</p>

<p>The meal was much enjoyed, and at its conclusion,
Will remarked:</p>

<p>“Have you decided what to do with me, Uncle
Andy?”</p>

<p>“Well—no—not exactly,” replied Mr.&#160;Swaim.
“Do you want to stay with me, or go back with
your friends for a while? One thing is certain,
you’ll not go back to that rascal of a Lewis Gabel.
I’ll take you from his charge.”</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_284" href="#Page_284"><span title="284">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“I’d like to go with Jack and his chums,” said
Will, “only they’ll be going back East soon, I expect,
and they haven’t got an extra horse for me
to ride.”</p>

<p>“We can easily manage that,” said Jack. “I’ve
got to send word to Tanker Ike to come and get
our camp stuff, and he can just as well bring along
an extra horse with him. So don’t let that worry
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m giving you a lot of trouble,”
said Will.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. Come, and welcome.”</p>

<p>“If you can manage it, I think it will be the
best plan,” said Mr.&#160;Swaim. “My camp isn’t much
of a place for a boy, but I will soon be coming
East, Will, and then I’ll look after you. In the
meanwhile take this to use for the spending money
that Mr.&#160;Gabel wrongfully kept from you,” and
he handed his nephew a substantial <del class="correction">sum.”</del><ins
    class="correction"
    title="Transcriber’s Note: original has a quote after the period">sum.</ins></p>

<p>The boys took a last look at the aeroplane, and
bidding Mr.&#160;Swaim good-by, set off on a long
tramp over the mountain for their camp. Fortunately
the weather was fine, and they were not
hampered by any storm, so they reached their tent
late that afternoon.</p>

<p>“Jugitback?” asked Budge, as calmly as if they
had been gone only an hour or so, and he pulled out
a long string of gum, and began to work it back
into his mouth again.</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_285" href="#Page_285"><span title="285">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Yes, we’re here,” said Jack. “Did you and
Long Gun get along all right?”</p>

<p>“Sure’syou’reafoothigh.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon begin packing for home——”</p>

<p>“Home? You mean Pryor’s Gap, I guess,” exclaimed
Nat. “You’re not going without seeing
Mabel; are you?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your affair,” retorted Jack, his
face reddening under his tan.</p>

<p>“We ought to have one more hunt before we
go,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” put in Bony, and Jack agreed.</p>

<p>They spent two days more tramping over the
mountains after game. Will killed a fair-sized
bear, Nat got a large deer, and Jack bowled over
a great ram, that had a fine pair of horns, which
our hero declared he was perfectly satisfied with, as
they would appropriately fill a certain space on the
wall of his room.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said, as they were gathered
around the camp fire that night, “I think the outing
of our gun club is almost at an end.”</p>

<p>“Got to go to Pryor’s Gap yet!” murmured Nat
from the shadows, and the rest of them laughed.</p>

<p>The next day Long Gun started on his horse to
take word to Tanker Ike that the boys were ready
to come back. He was gone two days, which the
lads put in by packing up, and taking little trips,
not far from their camp. The third day the Indian<a class="pagenum" id="Page_286" href="#Page_286"><span title="286">&#160;</span></a>
returned with the freight wagon, driven by
Ike, who also brought along an extra horse for
Will.</p>

<p>“Well!” he exclaimed, “you certainly had great
luck,” and he looked at the collection of skins and
horns. “But it’s about time to go back. There’s
a big storm coming, and it’ll be here soon.”</p>

<p>“We must take plenty of water this time, so if a
tank springs a leak on the desert we won’t get
thirsty,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to cross the desert,” spoke
Jack.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because we’re going back by way of Pryor’s
Gap,” explained Jack boldly, and he did not heed
the shouts of laughter that greeted his announcement.
“We promised to call on Mr.&#160;Pierce, you
know,” he added.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Mr.&#160;Pierce, with the accent on the
<i>Mister</i>,” shouted Nat, and then he dodged behind
the wagon to get out of Jack’s reach.</p>

<p>Two days later they were at Pryor’s Gap, and
Mr.&#160;Pierce was glad to see them. He insisted that
they stay several days at his house, to which Jack
agreed. But his host did not see much of our hero,
for, somehow, there were many sights of interest
about the Gap, and no one seemed able to point
them out to Jack, save a certain brown-eyed maiden—but
there, what’s the use of rubbing it in?</p><p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_287" href="#Page_287"><span title="287">&#160;</span></a></p>

<p>“Well, I hope you lads will come camping out
here again, soon,” said Mr.&#160;Pierce, as the members
of the gun club prepared to take their leave.</p>

<p>“I hope we can,” said Jack. “We have enjoyed
the hospitality of you and your daughter very
much.”</p>

<p>“Especially the daughter,” put in Nat, in a voice
intended only for Jack’s ear. “You old duffer,
you monopolized her.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed Jack. “Who had a better
right?”</p>

<p>“Good-by, boys!” called Mr.&#160;Pierce.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” chorused the members of Jack
Ranger’s gun club.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” spoke Mabel, with a blush, but she
only looked at Jack. “Come again.”</p>

<p>“We will,” said our hero decidedly, as he held
her hand at parting a little longer than perhaps was
strictly necessary. But, as we asked before, what’s
the use of rubbing it in?</p>

<p>“We certainly had a great time,” observed Will,
as they started off from Pryor’s Gap.</p>

<p>“The best ever,” agreed the others.</p>

<p>“I wonder what we’ll do next year,” spoke Sam.</p>

<p>But what they did will be told in the next volume
of this series, to be entitled “Jack Ranger’s
Treasure Box; or, The Outing of the Schoolboy
Yachtsmen.” In that story we shall meet all our<a class="pagenum" id="Page_288" href="#Page_288"><span title="288">&#160;</span></a>
old friends again and learn the particulars of a
most unusual mystery, and how it was solved.</p>

<p>A few days later the boys were in a train that
was swiftly taking them back East, and to Washington
Hall, which institution, as Jack learned in a
letter from his father, that was waiting for him at
Denver, had been repaired, and was ready for the
students.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, to think of going back to studies
again,” sighed Nat, as he thought of the fun they
had had.</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ll have some sport yet,” consoled
Jack. “Professors Socrat and Garlach are
still available.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and think of the experience we have had,”
said Will.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we always have some sort of queer
experience when we go out with Jack Ranger,”
added Nat. “All out for Pryor’s Gap,” he shouted,
as the train pulled into a station. Then he ducked
down behind a seat to escape a wad of paper that
Jack threw at him.</p>
